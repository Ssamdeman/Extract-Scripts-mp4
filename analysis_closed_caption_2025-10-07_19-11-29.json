Who's good knowledge was\u2026\nYeah.\nYeah, so\u2026\nSo, for people here, you can just open the standard\nWe'll come in, we'll come in.\nDamn, this thing's powerful.\nMy eye's getting sucked out.\nWait, so hold on. Oh, that's a thing, I hate that I have to admit, people.\nLike, how can I\u2026 do you guys know how can I, like, disable the\u2026\nPost features\u2026 oh, here we go.\nUh\u2026 unmute himself, share docs, share, uh, request\u2026\ncross\u2026 cross-record collaborator on the Zoom app.\nshared meeting times when participants, suspend participants.\nUh, Hugo, I think?\nNow, people can just join in.\nWell, we have only two people right now, so\u2026\nHopefully we can have a little bit more than that.\nAlright.\nOkay. I will\u2026\nTechnically, it was started\u2026\nThis one's gonna be\u2026\na little bit\u2026 a little bit different than previous form.\nWe're mainly gonna focus on doing stuff, so I'm gonna be a less talker,\nAnd you guys will be more doers.\nUh, hopefully\u2026\nGoogle online, I don't know who the\u2026 I need\u2026\nDamn, I didn't make a participation thing. Oh, Lewis didn't do it, that's fine.\nUm, I didn't make any\u2026\nOkay.\nUm, so\u2026\nFor now, everybody\u2026 I think\u2026\nDid I give it time? I'll just start now?\nLet's see\u2026 I think just\u2026\nJust gonna start\u2026 people are gonna show up.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nUh\u2026\nwhere we're gonna start, right?\nHold on\u2026\nWe have people\u2026\nPerfect. Whatever. Alright.\nEverybody basically opened up their\u2026\nWhat's up, man? Are you interested in cybersecurity?\nWait, is that?\nIs that you? Who\u2026 I\u2026\nHuh?\nGotcha.\nWait, no, no, no. Am I\u2026 am I talking to\u2026\nthrough Discord? No, it was the email.\nGotcha.\nNo, I'm not Ryan.\nBrian's the president, I am instructor. So, that's fine, yeah, yeah, in the local terminals.\nAlright, you're not gonna participate, you just want to watch? Or you want to participate?\nOh, that definitely reminds me.\nNo, we just need your computer, that's all. Buy a computer.\nAlright, everybody open the bandit\u2026\nThe thing I sent you guys.\nCome on, who follow the instructions. Everyone should follow the instructions.\nPerfect. Oh, damn, we solved it.\nWhat'd you got into? I'm at 11, 12, like, no. Nice.\nOkay. Ah, keep working on it then.\nUh, if you want more challenges, let me know, give you the site, okay?\nHow about you? Who?\nYou're starting it, perfect.\nAlright, just open it, go to\u2026\nUh, go to Bandit\u2026 just look at Bandit,\nCTF. Yeah, so you gotta\u2026\nStu, how are you? You don't have to use your terminal, uh, VM for this. You can just\u2026\nStop that one, because it's going to take so much power out of the computer.\nUm\u2026\nThere's another one. Go to your gym itself, yeah, it's, like, canceled from that.\nUh, we're just gonna go to Bandit.com.\nYou know, how to do, like, instruction-wise.\nAnd start solving it slowly.\nUm, whoever's online, I think you can try to do, too.\nI'm just gonna make it brief, you guys keep working, whatever, I'm just gonna make a recording, it's like, what is CTF?\nIt's a thing that you're already doing right now. Again, don't give attention to me, I'm just talking to myself, basically.\nAnd whoever online. Uh, CTF is about\u2026\nsolving our problems. If you're a software engineer, you guys have heard of it, the lead code.\nIt's basically the same equivalency you bought in a cyber domain, cybersecurity domain.\nSo there's a different types of cyber, uh, different types and styles of CTF.\nWhat I mean by type is a different kind of skill set, so different kind of systems. There's a WebExplotation,\nphotography, reverse engineering, forensics,\nbinary exploitation.\nAgain, they might be a little more different somewhere else, but that's a general category. Every city of challenges can fall in.\nThere's a different style of delivering CTF itself, like Jeopardy style, where you choose your\nYou get more points for the harder and weaker and small and, like, easier one, you get less points, so you have a totally higher point that you win.\nAn attack defense, which is a little different than you imagine, or you've experienced. It's more about\nYou have this justice system,\noperating system, like your computer, and try to exploit that system or defend by it.\nAnd also, combination of two. Come down, when you have Jeopardy, inside Jeopardy, you can choose that\nUh, like, attack defense system to work with.\nUh, that's a cool thing to know about the CTF itself.\nSo, the reason I put this, it's all about problem solving.\nI repeat, capture the flag, it's all about problem solving, and that's why\nAnd also, understanding that what\u2026\ntools you have. That's why I got\u2026 I thought you got first VMs, because those are really important.\nIf you want to do something, because there's some, like, web exploitation, or\u2026\nUh, binary exploitation, actually. You don't want to use your own computer,\nBecause you might break it. So that's why you've got to create a VM, work there,\nto configure some stuff out.\nUh, my whole goal today is go\u2026 basically go through with you,\nall the challenges.\nYeah. I already did it.\nLike, I finish from 1 to 20,\nBut I want to go through again, how I would approach each problem, or, like, how to read it and understand it.\nUm, let's see\u2026 yeah, all my codes are here. Alright.\nOn the way, you can follow me, or you can do it by yourself, keep working on it.\nI don't have to listen what I'm saying, just sticky, I guess.\nElsa, what the fuck? Where's the people at?\nHello.\nI'm gonna go online do I have?\nDamn, I have warm people, one person.\nAll right. You guys suck at it.\nAlright, alright. Um\u2026\nI see you guys saw the last email, I created\u2026 I announced, like, AI integration,\nAnd I hope you did anybody follow up on that? I feel like nobody did, but that is okay.\nBecause the reason I wanted to do that, I can show you what I'm gonna do, so I'll do\u2026\nor open\u2026\nwhere you are\u2026\nOh, wow, I must start.\nAll right. Basically, I am starting\nOpen Web UI, I'm not sure if you're sure of it.\nis basically AI, right?\nYou guys know what AI is, I'm just using it in my own environment.\nI want you guys to get hands-on experience on it.\nThat's the only reason I'm\u2026 I am\u2026\ngiving you the staff, because it's important.\nSo you can say you did something with AI, because everybody cares about you're doing AI or not.\nUh, it's gonna\u2026 so, once you start everything, you can go local,\nWolf Cove\u2026\nlocal host.\nSo, it opens up this\u2026 oh, no, so that's what it is. Alright, so\u2026\nYou'll have to register it, but I use a different browser, that's why it's not letting me to do it.\nWe're gonna do a different brother for here.\nI'm gonna close this for a bit\u2026\nAnd then, open all here.\nDiscard\u2026\nUh, slide\u2026\nUh, this first slide, and local edit 8.\nSo I'm already here\u2026\nHuh. I know it's here, alright.\nBasically, now it's running on your local machine, it can say, uh\u2026\nWhat's your\u2026\nWhat's your job?\nAnd then my AI responds like this.\nHopefully, it will not break mine.\nmy computer, because it's a computer-intensive.\nSo, use your own say. So, it says\u2026\nAlright, I'm ready to Maduro branch into back here my language at that.\nSo, the chat that I shared with you guys, those are designed for solving specifically, like, capture the flag problems.\nI want you to use AI to solve your problems if you don't know.\nYes.\nThe article that I shared with you, the link that I shared with you, tells you everything.\nHuh?\nUh, are you in the group chat? Are you in the email?\nYou have\u2026 yeah, that's email. All the emails in there.\nfor the AI system?\nYou don't need it. Virtual machine, you need it eventually, but not for these purposes, or today's purposes.\nLast time we set up. But\u2026\nI'm just showing you guys this skill, just be aware that you can use AI to solve it. That's the only reason I'm showing you.\nOh, Bender, it's Chafukurah, bended\u2026\nNo, you don't. So that's what\u2026 that was the first lesson, right, we did.\nSo we're looking on board virtual machines. If you\u2026 if you're in the Discord, you'll get all the information there as well. Join the Discord.\nUm, but\u2026\nSo, coming back to the solo problems, right?\nWho's\u2026 who finished number one?\nor zero. I know you're finished. You were ahead. Don't raise your hand anymore.\nUntil we catch up to you. We could ever do it again, just tell us how you sold it, I guess, like, your process of thinking.\nWho finished at number one, number two? Number one is kind of too easy to play.\nActually, hold on.\nwanted to, let's say, can I connect to the\u2026\nGonna connect through terminal\u2026\nYeah, I think\u2026\nI'm gonna start working on starting from 2.\nWe're rich in this room, who's at number 2?\nOkay, perfect. At least one.\nThen, I hope it's the same password.\ndamn. Stinks.\nI'm just gonna just go through quickly. Um\u2026\nAgain, the\u2026 I will re-emphasize the purpose of today's class is to learn how to do this stuff, right?\nIt would be ambiguous, it would be hard, it will be all of it.\nUh, but before I do go to\u2026\nFirst one says, okay, your password\u2026\nYou've been with Jira, and then\u2026\nI'm gonna be bound to the past with zero\u2026\nSo yeah, alright.\nhave README\u2026\nSo that's number one, that's the\u2026\nAlright, so we're gonna exit\u2026\nGonna go back to number 1\u2026\nI'm just catching up to you guys, don't\u2026 I'm not explaining\u2026\nBecause you guys already passed through this.\nSo\u2026\nSudhu\u2026\nWait, whose band is number one right now on their shell?\nTide pool is\u2026\nWho is\u2026 I know you got it.\nEverybody's above number one?\nOkay.\nI would love them.\nWe can do this, this\u2026 Oh, here we go. Bye.\nYeah, so who's number 2 right now? It says number 2 on the con\u2026 on the terminal.\nUh, the plasma literature as well?\nOkay?\nSo, CD, I mean\u2026\nAlright, who's at the Bandit 3?\nLike, they're logged in as 3.\nI wanted to move forward.\nAlright, let's see what you're at, where you're at.\nSo, open your terminal.\nSo you're gonna do\u2026 do you know about SSH?\nSo, we'll do that.\nUh\u2026 they can just do SSH. Wait, hold on, you banded zero, yeah, you're already in.\nYeah, so do LS.\nHow did I read that thing?\nHow about you? Alright.\nDamn boys. Alexa skin, tiny screen, it's smart.\nExactly. Basics for the job, um\u2026\nHow about you? Are you number 3?\nUm, for some time, I lost.\nyour code number? Yeah, that's what happened. That's why\u2026 this is\u2026\nBy the way, I think\u2026\nTell me, um, what's your problem now? Like, you tell me, what kind of problem you're facing right now?\nSay that louder, one more time?\nWhat he's trying to say, he lost the flat. That's what it is. You lost the flag to get into the next step.\nThat's why you need to have a good note-taking system. Have somewhere\nyou put your notes there.\nLike, for me, for example, the way I solved it is that I start putting notes like this.\nLike, 0 to 1, 2 to 3\u2026\nYou need to have it, because\u2026\nyou will forget, you will do a lot of commands.\nThat's why we put them somewhere that you have access 24-7.\nNote-taking is very important in cybersecurity.\nbasically a career. Wanna be good in cybersecurity? Well, well, start taking notes.\nUm, so, to everybody, it seems like on the 3 now.\nSure. Since you also have to start\nAgain,\nUh, let's see\u2026\nAnd if you have questions, let me know.\nBecause this is why I'm here.\nUh, I do 3 now\u2026\nCB\u2026\nYes. I have, okay, I can, I can get to that.\nIt's right to, like, uh, save this?\nBecause it's just, like\u2026\nBecause I think where Reset will go out.\nNo, you are, because\u2026 so what you did is that you entered this\u2026\nUm, you inside the CAT command.\nStill, like, if you do something, it happens, like, weird thing. The way you cancel it, just, like,\nSee? Ctrl-C. What happened is that you just entered a command,\nYou know, IUCS?\nYeah, but I haven't taken the class. Gotcha. Basically, you're inside the loop, just circling around.\nThis one expecting some kind of command.\nAnd that's what happens. So usually what happens with CTRL-C, it exits out.\nSo, try again. You're right, that's what you do, is the CAD file\u2026\nBut if you don't know exactly, use ChatGPT to, like,\nsearch it, because this is what I want to encourage everybody to problem-solving. It's not about just your brain using it to solve it.\nfor using resources you have to solve the problem.\nAnd also, I understand why that works, not just like, oh, I sold no. Like, I understand why.\nhow they did it, what command they used, why they used it.\nJust, like, not too much, but a little bit of understanding the basics.\nI hear making voice above.\nAll right. Now, so\u2026\nDo you know about terminals and different terminals?\nOkay.\nSo, look at this. Cause it.\nAlright, so you're in already banned it, right? Perfect. What bandit are you on?\nZero? Okay. Go down.\nSo what you\u2026 and then do LS.\nWait, no, first start clear.\nYeah, press enter.\nAlright, thanks. Do LS now.\nOkay. Now, your README page, right? You need to read that. Do you know how to open a file?\npath, and then\u2026\nPerfect. Well, it says.\nThat's your\u2026 copy that.\nNo, you copied it wrong. Copy it again.\nThe reason you did it wrong, you see, you see, you're grabbing the spaces.\nYou're grabbing the spaces. If you grab the space, it's gonna be wrong.\nAlright.\nCopy-paste, copy, yeah. And then exit.\nYep. And now, we're gonna go\u2026\nArrow, top arrow.\nAnd now you see you have 0, you're gonna change it to 1.\nEnter.\nAnd now, as password, what was the password again?\nExactly, you're gonna copy-paste it.\nPress Enter.\nYou copy it wrong, so make sure you don't get spaces, so there's\u2026 look at the front, I think you're getting front.\nHow about you? You good?\nYou got it. Now, Duquette.\nI'm a freshman. I don't even see the pass.\nnotes. Put in your notes. Like, that's what I was telling you guys, you're gonna\u2026 if you lose that thing, you have to go back.\nSo create a note to save it, make sure there's no\u2026\nspaces, or, like\u2026\nHero, you got it. Yeah, exactly, it helps out.\nAlright\u2026\nHow's your thing going?\nI know, it sucks.\nHow about you?\nNo, you press 8. Oh, you don't\u2026 oh, you can do that?\nBecause the lawyer?\nThere you go? You should stay alert, so I'm not gonna feel so bad.\nSo, Eva, thanks so much.\nMy friend got me a drink, because I am.\nrunning a lot.\nSo, uh\u2026\nHow many people do I have? Not even one anymore. Oh, well, it's only me now, so\u2026\nYeah\u2026\ngreat turnout today, yeah\u2026\nAlright. Uh\u2026\nAlright, alright, and bam.\nSo, let's start solving the problem. Where am I now? So, I'm gonna bend it to you, right?\nSo, I'm also facing a problem here right now, but\u2026\nthere's a hidden file, I need to open it, and I'm having a hard time opening it. Well, actually\u2026\nNot anymore.\nprocess it, and got the answer.\nSo, again, it also\u2026\nIt's about solving a problem. I think you guys got that part.\nReally good. We're gonna make a competition end of the semester.\nHow are we gonna show up and do some stuff?\nI was gonna do what\u2026\nHey, if someone has to log out, that's pretty cool. I didn't know that.\nI got the full band, so\u2026\nGotcha.\nWhoo! So?\nNow, when you go 3, 2, 4, I think 4\u2026\nBut\u2026 yeah.\nThe Barcelona nerves of some of the format, da-da-da-da\u2026\nOne\u2026\nYeah, I don't know.\nI even forgot how to do it.\nSo it's a passport Nexo stored in a humanitable format in a hard drive. Alright, so\u2026\nThese, uh, files?\nWe're gonna do, I think, forward.\nHow do I do it? So, perfect example, right? Like, okay, you start, you try to test your knowledge, and you're like, alright, let's go\u2026 let's solve this one. So you're gonna go\u2026\nI don't know what you guys use, but whatever AI tool you use, use it.\nUh, in order to use AI,\nYou have to specify\nwhat it wants\u2026 what it needs to do, like, uh, tell them, you are\u2026\nTTF expert, and I am solving\nSolving, and I need\u2026 and I need\u2026\nYour help.\nHere's the issue.\nHere's the challenge.\nHere in the\u2026 I cannot see it right now, so I'm just\u2026\nclobbering. Don's, and\u2026\nalso explain how to work.\nHow it works\u2026\nSo, once you give the thing, it doesn't\u2026 it does a thing, right? It's a waste of energy, don't get me wrong, but, like,\nHey, that's how you learn nowadays.\nAll right, so it tells you, like, okay.\nSo you do this, and then\u2026\nFinally, to my next special relationship, file 7, whatever file name identifies their title.\nI actually learned how to work, right? Like, what it does, what it's doing.\nSo, I was right, but\u2026\nI'm doing it, but I'm not getting the SEL table, like\u2026\nWhen I do the\u2026\nfine. Oh, that's why I'm using the wrong command, if I do the file, that's fine.\nAnd then it gives you\u2026\nSo I was like, alright, so I wanted your file gave me error, so I'm gonna say,\nUh, when I do a file, I'm\u2026\ngetting\u2026\nI am getting\u2026\nThis\u2026\nerror. Ta-da!\nAnd then called it pasted, but it's like\u2026\nWaiting, waiting.\nAnd it says, like, oh, adding this into workflow, expand the file name to everything, so it's gonna do files,\nThat's this.\nAnd then pops up. And then this is it.\nSo what are we gonna do? We're gonna do cat\u2026\nRight.\nSometime a fix happens?\nAnd they're kept.\nDamn.\nAlright, I think it's too many commands.\nOh, I gotcha!\nThat's my flag. We're gonna do exit\u2026\nUnder\u2026\n5\u2026\nAnd what I post it here.\nBut you should also understand why we're learning a certain command, right? Like,\nEvery time when you have this kind of thing, think about, like, how are you gonna solve it?\nby thinking, how can you use it in your own\nyour own issue. Let's say you have a file,\nAnd you're trying to search it. What do you do? Are you gonna do a file, or you're gonna do find? So it's like\u2026\njust good knowledge to have that, so it teaches you how to do it.\nAnd so, no, and\u2026 yeah.\nI'll make another walk around.\nIt's overwhelming, and that's the whole purpose.\nHow are you doing?\nWhich one? Exactly, right? So\u2026\nHow are you gonna solve\u2026 let's see, that's a problem, right? You cannot grab it. What are you gonna do next?\nbought another one coming in.\nSo you\u2026 but you know out of your mind\u2026 you remember the commands.\nWell, the ones, like, um, Brian, I know we\u2026\nExactly. That's what we use.\nbe hired to help you out.\nThat's what I was telling you over there, like,\ntake that, copy-paste it,\nand give the ChatGPT and say, hey, there's a problem, so how can I open this file?\nAnd it gives me an answer, oh, give you a solution.\nI want you guys to use your\u2026\nproblem-solving approach here, instead of just, oh, I solved it.\nLike, it's great you can solve it, but if you're like an expert, hey.\nHooray to you, but\u2026\nIn that situation, I want you to develop your\u2026\nthinking of how you're gonna solve certain problems when you don't know how to do it, or what to do.\nNo, I'm just uncompressing YouTube. Yeah, there's\u2026 I worked on yesterday, it took a bit.\nIt's, like, 8 times, 10 times on this? Yeah, it's annoying.\nHow are you doing?\nSo, let me help you out a little bit here, right?\nwhat's something not clear in your eyes?\nLike, what's the problem that you're facing right now?\nIdentify the problem first, like, what's a problem?\nYes.\nSo, if you go up\u2026\nSo that's the problem, right? Like, and you don't know, you don't want to go open every single of them, right? That's a problem.\nYou wanna take it. So now\u2026\nDoes the command to give you as a hint, you see, as a hint of how to do it 3 to 5, yeah, so now\u2026\nI want you from level\u2026 oh, the password to\u2026\nto the fine, copy, paste, copy.\nfrom the command to here.\nOh, it sounds out.\nIt's\u2026 slide deck's described in the copy.\nSo, now, so that's the problem, right? Like, this is the problem, and what you're gonna do\u2026\nYou're gonna do\u2026 do you have ChatGPT?\nUh, I have on\u2026\nYeah. Oh, somewhere else.\nSo\u2026\ntell what's your problem? Say, I don't\u2026 describe what you're struggling with.\nDid we want to just, like\u2026\nHow many things going? No, describe, like, problem. What's your struggling?\nI think you said exactly need to protect that.\nNo, no, no, don't do that. Just the thing that you just told me.\nWhat did you tell me?\nYou told me, like, there's a\u2026 there's a file that one of them has password. I don't know how to find a password.\nNo, stop. Should not have done that.\nSo, think about you using it to solve the problem that you're facing.\nAnd the way I'm just teaching you this framework, how to think about it, right? You're gonna describe how to find a\nAt the point passed in a group of files.\nUh, you\u2026 and now you have to give them what the context. Like, that's the primary goal.\nYou should give them context. Like, say, I'm doing CTF,\nI'm doing CTF, at least something.\nPut it down.\nOkay, I'm doing CTF.\nAnd then copy, paste it, and say, like, here's a challenge.\nAnd cover bases.\nAnd then set.\nnow what you did is that you tell them what was the problem, what the context, like, where to look at it.\nAnd ChatGPT have the\u2026 and then the\u2026\nAnd then, like, what was instruction from original?\nI was thinking for you, like, it's a way of problem approaching.\nWho was that? Alright. Hell yeah.\nHow's\u2026 how are you going?\nstruggling to work? Do you need help with anything?\nGreat, nice, nice.\nYes, the funky.\nIt'll work for any, like, weird characters.\nYeah, technically, yeah. So, what do you\u2026 I learned that yesterday, too, that's why I like teaching, because I learned myself.\nIt's a thing, turns out you just command.\nSo, every time when you have\u2026 that's a command line.\ntools. The command line has their flags.\nSo, when you do dash, it's a flag, thinking something else.\nBut if you dot things\u2026 oh, no, it's not a flag, it's a command I want you to do, open it.\nAnd that's what happened.\nThat's a good one, actually.\nYeah, you see?\nDid it give you the right answer? Like\u2026\ncause enough answer.\nOkay.\nAlways go the simplest one all the time.\nQuick and simple, always for that.\nYou got it?\nIt doesn't seem to be a VIN for a tech director.\nNo, this is a very tricky one. So what you're gonna do, you're gonna do LSLA, do LSLA.\nYeah, so look at\u2026 wait, no, no, no, no, go back to your home directory.\nLSI.\nAnd you see the SSH.\nYeah. That's your key, I think that's how you go through?\nIs that what you're saying, anyway? Yeah, so for this level\u2026\nNo, I've already, like\u2026 Are you in there? Dude. Like, I've SSH'd from Bandon 13. Ah, okay, you did already, you're in there.\nyou in the HS14 now.\nRight? Yeah, I'm at 14. Yeah, dude, then\u2026 do cat. HC, this one.\nIt's much easier, yeah.\nYeah, that's, like, a root level of cloud. It's better to\u2026\nI have to cover basically the list error from\u2026 I got it.\nYep. We were\u2026\nstuck anywhere? No, I just made it.\nHow are you doing?\nDon't be discouraged. What's the problem? What's\u2026 what's the thing you don't understand?\nSo, um, back, that's\u2026\nOkay, so copy-paste the\u2026 the challenge.\nthe whole child, right? Alright, go back to the chat you had.\nAll right. So\u2026\nhow I'm doing\u2026 see, no, no, no, no, no, go back.\ndeleted. You don't need it right now.\nJust write down, say, I'm working,\nOn CTF Challenge.\nSwitching down.\nthe 60F1 bad standard.\nYeah, not very official app.\nNot very easy to show that. That's right. And then\u2026\nHere's a challenge, how to solve it.\nMe? No. Oh.\nAgain, you have this word, that's important.\nUm, no, I'm just, like\u2026\nSo far as a student defended from 0 to 20 today.\nI also introduced a new concept of local LLMs.\nHopefully they get interested, they can build content up with you.\nI specifically look upon, uh, fine-tuned for coding.\nSo I was like, oh, let's maybe do something.\nOh, I'm a thing.\nIf you really do understand what's happening there, and then you can solve that way.\nAgain, always go simple and quick. Don't do crazy stuff.\nOne of my old coworkers, uh, did you ever meet Cam?\nI think the guy who's called a software engineer, right? What? The guy who did a lot of coding, right, for you guys? Yeah. He thought you. The guy that trained me.\nYeah. Um, he just reached out and was like, hey, Adam, um, I think I have a potential CTF team could be up together, that he used to be part of, so I might go join him and do that.\nRight, it should do it. Yeah, it's a lot of work, but\u2026 I mean\u2026\nIt's a fun time together, and then\u2026\nI imagine, uh, I always believe that, I think that's exactly playing a\u2026\nUm, any kind of game? Like, yeah, you did this, no, you did this.\nthrough the remote, especially.\nI mean, I think it's cool, too.\nUm, John? I think I went through most abandoned.\nI think a long time ago, when I was getting started.\nPerfect style, that's fine. People are learning slowly.\nOoh, next lesson would be about\u2026\nColor Linux, I would have sent them out. That one.\ncolor. Wait, no, no. That's crazy. Linux.\nJust Linux, sorry. Hackerbox, I already introduced a\u2026 I put some seeds on it, but hey, start doing it.\nThe next class will be just all about that, like\u2026\nYeah. Um\u2026\nI don't know if I need to work on how many\u2026 depending on how many social apps. I'm trying to work on the capital applied. Do you think she'll do it, even if it doesn't show up?\nAm I gonna do it? No. I am. I'm saying, should I do it still not\u2026 like, was a\u2026\nWell, I think you should talk to them and see what they want to do, because, um, I, like, I still have my\u2026\nDo you remember when I did my presentation at, um\u2026\nOh, I forgot. That was it?\nDartmouth? Dartmouth, yeah. So far away. I still have my slide shirt if you want me to present with those.\nto them, teach them about, like, what tools we use on campus for cybersecurity and stuff, so\u2026 That's good.\nI mean, I think it's less advanced than what you're doing here. Really catching a bunch of music! I mean, it depends on what\u2026 How's it, man?\nIt was going good, but I got class. This is fun, though. Yeah.\nShow up.\nYeah. Ryan told your comment, never give you anything? That's crazy, man. Go join the UMass Involve.\nAnd there's a website, damn it, you should have\u2026\nSame time, same here.\nNot every Wednesday. Oh, every Wednesday and time, yeah.\nJust like the first one? This is the second one.\nShe does. See you, Matt.\nHow is it?\nUm\u2026\nPlease do sound conversions?\nExactly, right? So, look, like, I can tell you now\u2026 I mean, I think\u2026 Yeah, so what's the\u2026 We have something else off the top of your head? No, TAR's the best one, too.\nSo it seems text decimal, so I can repeatedly compressed.\nthe creative directory template to work on resume matrix, just a little\u2026\nWhat do you\u2026 what they want as uncompress it?\nlike TAR XF.\ndo LS, hold on.\nI'm trying to do this. So, do a cat?\nCAD data, yeah. Okay, so what are you gonna do, um\u2026\ncheesy, I think. Yeah, so you're gonna do\u2026 rename it, I feel like? Yeah, I think you do need to rename. Rename it to see\u2026\nI mean, yeah, it is, like, data that\u2026\nPR, disease? Oh, okay. PZ1?\nGoogle it, I don't know, usually\u2026\nLook at the chat. That's what the chat says.\nAnd\u2026 Ah.\nJust look at how to uncompress hecadecimal into\u2026\nYeah, how to encompass heckadecimal.txt.\nBecause it's like, use your, like, why you're doing it and how you're doing it, basic explanation of the other kind. Yeah.\nExactly, that's a whole thing, that's a\u2026 you're gonna\u2026 if you go\u2026\ndeeper, deeper, like, go bigger number, you're gonna get weird shit. I'm like, yo, crazy.\nHow are you? How are you?\nWe could have to keep a big one, that's a key.\nLike, what's that mean?\nHow you going? Look at that, progressing slowly.\nPerfect.\nHow about you? Struggling? Yeah, that's\u2026\nI did that a lot yesterday.\nSo, I can teach you a little cool thing here, like, when you go up,\nUh, we can do the same\u2026 we're gonna look up the same\u2026\nThis one, where you know, how did you do this one, right?\nbut also this thing called 2D\u2026\nNo\u2026\nOkay, that's not right. This one will go up this one.\nDo you know how to remove all the null permission denied parts? Normally, that's\u2026 Oh, uh\u2026\nchange mine? No, it's about the\u2026 it's in this one, remember the syntax there? I forget the syntax. Yeah, can you just Google it?\nCan I go with this one? Copy-paste this one\u2026\nYeah, this whole thing, yeah, too. Yep, that one.\nAnd post, like, how\u2026\nright format for this, I guess, how to do this?\nGo up.\nThat's what\u2026 that's what you do. No, no, that's\u2026\nSo, yeah. So copy that now.\nAnd go back to the thing, and replace that one.\nJust type it in the user.\nOh, I switched it, it's a dev\u2026\nFlash, no. I was\u2026\nYeah, I think he's back in. You got it.\nLook at that! It's a thing that I learned. It took me a bit to figure out, too. Just a thing that the removal of permissions, because we don't have much permissions.\nSo it helps out, like, there's always\u2026 if there's so much error,\npress down and see if it holds a problem.\nYeah, well\u2026\nYeah, looks like a multi-smo now.\nIs there, I think, normal? Always like that. I think it\u2026 that's just clubs in general, you know what I mean? Less people on campus now, that's\u2026\nfarther from the first week of classes.\nI didn't even online, man, nobody\u2026 I wonder if\u2026 let's see how many people there we have.\nWait, hold on.\nWow, zero!\nThat's alright.\nWhat I'm gonna do is that I'm gonna take this video,\ndo speech analysis on it.\nand improve my presentation skills.\nThat's a\u2026 that's a course of action on that.\nOr do you know about, um, the store?\nWhat? Do you not bought the stove?\nIt's amazing.\nlet's call Wapini, right?\nOpen the web view. I have not heard of that. Oh, it's amazing.\nYou know how LLM has really\u2026\nOh, I'm not a shady interface. Yeah.\nThis one takes it top notch, so you can basically\nfor any of our model. It's around the Obama, basically, and you can\u2026\ninteract with it. Oh, wow.\nlife and soul in one place. Yeah, and the crazy shit.\nIs that because now if you can build in, parts built in,\nLike\u2026 Very cool.\nCheck it out, bro, I've been using it.\nBut that, like, Black folks edited my stuff.\nAlso, you can load any LLM that's still homepage, get it downloaded.\nWell, I'm so\u2026 I'm so annoyed that I don't have good processing power to do some shit. Yeah.\nWhat do you want me to do, uh, to my slides one day?\nFor, like, what we use on campus.\nAnd it's that kind of stuff.\nDefinitely. We're just\u2026 I'm\u2026 I'm just being more considerable, like\u2026\nhow we, like, people are gonna\u2026\nLike, I don't want you to waste your time.\nYeah, I would ask them what they want. If they want to hear that, I'd be more to ask you if they don't give a shit, then\u2026\nExcellent, yeah. Um, then I\u2026 I just don't want to, like, places get people's fucking\u2026\nThe ones that, like, hey, bring the speaker to us here. I'm like, what?\nTo waste of their time, no, right? We don't have much cultural yet, but wait, you know what I'm saying? We don't have consistently people.\nYou don't mean to ask them.\nHuh? Tony asked them. I mean\u2026\nI know, I don't like\u2026 again, that's why I was, like, they're right here at the disaster.\nBecause we have, like, 50 people sign up now, you know?\nWell, I think it's just people are not gonna come.\nBecause, you know, people sign up\u2026 like, that's what I did when I started.\nBasically, you can set up for everything, and then, like, oh shit, I don't actually want to do this.\nHow can I make this one interesting? I think it's hella interesting. No, it's your fault. I think it's just\u2026\nThis is how it works, yeah. Especially being in computer school, you know what I mean?\nWait, what school? Community? Like, most people here don't live on campus.\nLike, you're gonna be you or something that pulls something else.\nThat's what defined difference, anything.\nHuh, I did never cross my mind that. I always thought, like, just\u2026\ndo not fucking like that, but it's about commuter school in 19th, but you're right.\nUh, who has questions?\nDamn!\nYeah, again, it's a stock using that to help you out.\nYou know, I don't really need that.\nreally\u2026\nThat's okay, yeah, I mean, it's a\u2026\nYeah, I'm not gonna hold you back. Where did you go back to work? Yeah. Thanks for showing on with me. Yeah, no problem.\nYeah. Chilli, man.\nIt's, like, I get it, you don't want to use it, that's okay, but, like, it's\u2026\nThe toll that, you know, disposal.\nAmazing tool. Like, amazing tool.\nI don't want to emphasize too much,\nBut that's how you can elevate your experience quicker and faster and more effectively.\nget something done.\nEspecially Google's a powerful tool.\nHow you doing? Oh yeah, 13 now. 14.\nYeah, that's a normal going on.\nAnd you cannot go anymore.\nall the way down, but\u2026 How did\u2026 did\u2026 no, but you cannot.\nOh, it says if it's\u2026\nDid you do it? Yeah.\nThe voice? Yeah. Because I have to do manual every single time, and I'm like, wow, I get stuck in a bit. That's my\u2026 This is being characteristic thing, so\u2026\nNo, hey, don't feel\u2026 guys, don't feel bad if you're in ChatGPT, like, you're not thinking. No, I don't. Yeah, just saying, it's your\u2026 Exactly, it's a tool, it's on your disposal. Use it to the fullest.\nYeah, so, yeah, I think\u2026\nThat's what today is like submitting, for sure.\npeople didn't show up, or something, but hard work didn't pay out.\nBecause I made slides and all of those. I was going to teach you guys permission stuff, but oh well.\nOn me.\nUh, we have another\u2026\n5 minutes, technically, so we can just still keep solving it until we figure it out.\nAgain, I gave you the tools to solve it.\nYou don't need me anymore, you can basically solve everything.\nAlmost everything to show off the classification that you're most about.\nHow's your doing? Helping you out?\nAt least, my video check works really well.\nThis is just the beginning, guys. This is a basic and easy one.\nThe other stuff, which is much harder.\nAnd that's why I wanted to introduce it.\nI want to put you in an environment where you feel stressed out,\nAnd you have no idea how the hell to approach it.\nThat's why I can tell you, welcome to CTF, that's why you're gonna feel every time when you sell on the CTF thing.\nDid you get 20? No, I'm still on\u2026\n16. What's the 16 of a socket? It's about, like, it's about, like, it's about, like, figuring out which parts have, like,\nIt's user endmark. Right. NMUP.\nYou're gonna use Nmap.\nAgain, I do use ChatScript in other Google HubSpot better.\nWait, you charge $59 a month, because ChatGPT has the end up, um\u2026\nwhat command to use to get it. Does that make sense?\nOr you don't use it on purpose. I feel like you don't use it on purpose.\nnormally, like, I also like this, like,\nHey! Someone who needed, like, the integrity of things.\nAll right, whatever\u2026\nWhat an interesting thing, man? What are\u2026\nAnd why you solve the problem. Just the problem is just problem\u2026 solving the problem.\nBut also, I just don't have a\u2026 That's crazy!\nYou're not joking, aren't you?\nSo, it's like that.\nAlright, this is conclude our meeting, guys.\nThank you for your time. I'll let you go a little early. You can stay as long as you want here.\nI'll be here for a bet.\nI'll be here until 3\u2026\n4.\nYeah, I'll be here for a bit, so, you know.\nJoin if you must, or stay if you must.",
