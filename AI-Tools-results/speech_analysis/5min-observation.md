        1 Watch body — hands, posture, eyes
            - too much hands movement. great way to show openeness but not when too much hands movement is distracting.
            - I am looking too much to the up and left or right. I am thinkg but not focused on the camera be okay with silence and just look at the camera.
            - when i am thinking or trying to come up with what to say, I do everyhing and not look at the camera. i look left and right and up and down. but not camera. 
            - Also while speaking I look around too much. I should be more focused on the camera. and audience. 
            - Good job on actiing and doing some action. Audience will be engaged.
            - too much hand movement that's for sure. 
            - over all not bad. many things to improve on but not bad. 

        2 (eyes closed): Listen — pace, tone, fillers, thought completion
            - not full pronounce words. 
            - somewhat slurring words. 
            -  not much energy in voice. 
            -  goood actiing but lack of voice action like inflasion and deflasion of voice. 
            -  constant pace which is bad. it must have ups and downs to make story interesting. 
            -  running out of breath. 
            - story it self is confusing. I dont have structgure. I feel like I am all over the place.

    1) Watch body — hands, posture, eyes
    - looking too much around and not at the camera. 
    - not looking at audience while I am making something new from my mind
    - less hand movement
    - my thinkning is not looking and avoiding the camera/audence while I am thinking what to say
    - too much blinking when I am thinking what to say and always looking right up. 
    - better imrpovent like less hand movement toward the end
    - bad habit of closehting my eyes and thinking and say thing staff. 

    2) (eyes closed): Listen — pace, tone, fillers, thought completion
