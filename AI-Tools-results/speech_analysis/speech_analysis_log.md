Damon, you’ve got the 3-2-1 framework down, but your delivery is currently fighting against your authority. You’re "thinking out loud" with your whole body instead of just your voice.

### **Speech Report Card**

| Category | Grade | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Structure** | **B-** | Followed 3-2-1, but the "2 types" section felt rushed/tacked on. |
| **Clarity** | **C+** | Concept of "experiencing vs. knowing" was strong; city logistics got muddy. |
| **Articulation** | **C-** | Slurring on word endings; "piled," "blew," and "south" lacked crispness. |
| **Delivery** | **D** | Flat energy and a "constant pace" that kills the drama of a blizzard. |
| **Body Language** | **F** | "Thinking eyes" (looking up/away) and distracting hand movements. |

### **The Biggest Problem**

**Eye-Contact Evasion.** The moment you need to process a thought, your eyes leave the camera and head for the ceiling or the corners. This breaks the "link" with your audience and makes you look like you're searching for an answer rather than leading the conversation.

### **The Drill: "The Lens Lockdown"**

For your next 5-minute talk, you are **forbidden** from looking away from the camera lens.

* If you forget what to say: **Stop talking.** * Maintain a "dead stare" at the lens in total silence until the thought comes.
* Do not look up, do not look down. Embrace the awkward silence while keeping eye contact. This builds "Command Presence."

### **Progress Note**

> **Log:** Framework followed correctly; focus now shifts from *what* is said to *how* it is projected—specifically eye-contact discipline.
