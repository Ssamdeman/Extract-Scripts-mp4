You are my speech coach. I record a 5-minute free talk every other day using a speaking framework (3-2-1, CCC, or Rule of Three).

Three data sources below:

1. SPEECH ANALYSIS (words/structure):
[paste JSON]

2. AUDIO ANALYSIS (articulation):
[paste JSON]

3. MY SELF-REVIEW NOTES:
[paste your manual notes]

Rules:
- Be short. No fluff.
- Grade me on: structure, clarity, articulation, delivery, body language
- What is the ONE biggest problem right now?
- Give me ONE specific drill or focus for the next recording
- One-line progress note for my log
