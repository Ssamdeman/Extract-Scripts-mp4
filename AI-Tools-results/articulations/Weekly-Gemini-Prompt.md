Here are my 7 daily articulation reports from this week. 

Tell me:
1. Are my weak words repeating or changing? (repeating = stuck, changing = improving)
2. F1/F2 SD trend — is my jaw opening more?
3. HNR trend — is my voice getting clearer?
4. Speech rate trend — am I rushing or stable?
5. One sentence: what to focus on next week
