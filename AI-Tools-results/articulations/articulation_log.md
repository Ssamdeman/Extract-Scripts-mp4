Six minutes right before you pass out is still better than zero minutes. Your data definitely reflects the fatigue, though—your speech was breathy (low HNR), and you got stuck in a massive repetition loop at the end ("to try early or young or fun").

Here is the breakdown of your session.

### Weak Words & Mechanics

* **Lip Closures (*million, philosophies, convenience, business*):** * *Why:* The pen physically blocks your lips. To hit M, P, B, F, and V sounds, you have to actively stretch your lips around the pen. Your tired muscles were entirely skipping this effort.
* **Tongue-Tip Stretches (*rooting, subtle, diamond, invisible*):** * *Why:* The pen locks your jaw open, meaning your tongue has to travel much further to hit the alveolar ridge (the roof of your mouth right behind your teeth). When you're sleepy, the tongue gets lazy, causing T, D, N, L, and S sounds to wash out.

*(Note: Since you didn't provide a previous session, we will use this as your "high-fatigue" baseline.)*

### Tomorrow's Focus

**Tongue Isolation.** Do not try to move your jaw to help your tongue out. Keep the pen perfectly stable and force your tongue tip to do 100% of the heavy lifting, especially on T, D, and L sounds.

### Progress Note for Log

`2/23 - 6 mins (pre-sleep). High fatigue slurred lip closures (m/p/b) and tongue-tip stretches (t/d/l). Next focus: Tongue isolation.`
