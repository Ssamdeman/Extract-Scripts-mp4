13:44:25 Okay, start recording.
13:44:28 Um…
13:44:38 Chickos? Who's good knowledge was…
13:44:46 Yeah.
13:44:56 Yeah, so…
13:44:58 So, for people here, you can just open the standard
13:45:14 We'll come in, we'll come in.
13:45:23 Damn, this thing's powerful.
13:45:26 My eye's getting sucked out.
13:45:29 Wait, so hold on. Oh, that's a thing, I hate that I have to admit, people.
13:45:35 Like, how can I… do you guys know how can I, like, disable the…
13:45:38 Post features… oh, here we go.
13:45:42 Uh… unmute himself, share docs, share, uh, request…
13:45:47 cross… cross-record collaborator on the Zoom app.
13:45:50 shared meeting times when participants, suspend participants.
13:45:57 Uh, Hugo, I think?
13:45:58 Now, people can just join in.
13:46:02 Well, we have only two people right now, so…
13:46:06 Hopefully we can have a little bit more than that.
13:46:12 Alright.
13:46:13 Okay. I will…
13:46:17 Technically, it was started…
13:46:18 This one's gonna be…
13:46:21 a little bit… a little bit different than previous form.
13:46:24 We're mainly gonna focus on doing stuff, so I'm gonna be a less talker,
13:46:30 And you guys will be more doers.
13:46:33 Uh, hopefully…
13:46:35 Google online, I don't know who the… I need…
13:46:37 Damn, I didn't make a participation thing. Oh, Lewis didn't do it, that's fine.
13:46:42 Um, I didn't make any…
13:46:48 Okay.
13:46:50 Um, so…
13:46:52 For now, everybody… I think…
13:46:54 Did I give it time? I'll just start now?
13:46:58 Let's see… I think just…
13:47:00 Just gonna start… people are gonna show up.
13:47:02 Okay.
13:47:05 Okay.
13:47:10 Uh…
13:47:11 where we're gonna start, right?
13:47:15 Hold on…
13:47:20 We have people…
13:47:33 Perfect. Whatever. Alright.
13:47:37 Everybody basically opened up their…
13:47:40 What's up, man? Are you interested in cybersecurity?
13:47:45 Wait, is that?
13:47:47 Is that you? Who… I…
13:47:50 Huh?
13:47:55 Gotcha.
13:47:58 Wait, no, no, no. Am I… am I talking to…
13:48:01 through Discord? No, it was the email.
13:48:03 Gotcha.
13:48:05 No, I'm not Ryan.
13:48:07 Brian's the president, I am instructor. So, that's fine, yeah, yeah, in the local terminals.
13:48:12 Alright, you're not gonna participate, you just want to watch? Or you want to participate?
13:48:18 Oh, that definitely reminds me.
13:48:21 No, we just need your computer, that's all. Buy a computer.
13:48:24 Alright, everybody open the bandit…
13:48:27 The thing I sent you guys.
13:48:30 Come on, who follow the instructions. Everyone should follow the instructions.
13:48:33 Perfect. Oh, damn, we solved it.
13:48:35 What'd you got into? I'm at 11, 12, like, no. Nice.
13:48:40 Okay. Ah, keep working on it then.
13:48:43 Uh, if you want more challenges, let me know, give you the site, okay?
13:48:47 How about you? Who?
13:48:51 You're starting it, perfect.
13:48:53 Alright, just open it, go to…
13:48:58 Uh, go to Bandit… just look at Bandit,
13:49:00 CTF. Yeah, so you gotta…
13:49:05 Stu, how are you? You don't have to use your terminal, uh, VM for this. You can just…
13:49:11 Stop that one, because it's going to take so much power out of the computer.
13:49:14 Um…
13:49:19 There's another one. Go to your gym itself, yeah, it's, like, canceled from that.
13:49:23 Uh, we're just gonna go to Bandit.com.
13:49:26 You know, how to do, like, instruction-wise.
13:49:28 And start solving it slowly.
13:49:31 Um, whoever's online, I think you can try to do, too.
13:49:37 I'm just gonna make it brief, you guys keep working, whatever, I'm just gonna make a recording, it's like, what is CTF?
13:49:44 It's a thing that you're already doing right now. Again, don't give attention to me, I'm just talking to myself, basically.
13:49:49 And whoever online. Uh, CTF is about…
13:49:53 solving our problems. If you're a software engineer, you guys have heard of it, the lead code.
13:49:59 It's basically the same equivalency you bought in a cyber domain, cybersecurity domain.
13:50:05 So there's a different types of cyber, uh, different types and styles of CTF.
13:50:11 What I mean by type is a different kind of skill set, so different kind of systems. There's a WebExplotation,
13:50:17 photography, reverse engineering, forensics,
13:50:20 binary exploitation.
13:50:22 Again, they might be a little more different somewhere else, but that's a general category. Every city of challenges can fall in.
13:50:30 There's a different style of delivering CTF itself, like Jeopardy style, where you choose your
13:50:36 You get more points for the harder and weaker and small and, like, easier one, you get less points, so you have a totally higher point that you win.
13:50:45 An attack defense, which is a little different than you imagine, or you've experienced. It's more about
13:50:50 You have this justice system,
13:50:53 operating system, like your computer, and try to exploit that system or defend by it.
13:50:57 And also, combination of two. Come down, when you have Jeopardy, inside Jeopardy, you can choose that
13:51:04 Uh, like, attack defense system to work with.
13:51:08 Uh, that's a cool thing to know about the CTF itself.
13:51:12 So, the reason I put this, it's all about problem solving.
13:51:17 I repeat, capture the flag, it's all about problem solving, and that's why
13:51:23 And also, understanding that what…
13:51:25 tools you have. That's why I got… I thought you got first VMs, because those are really important.
13:51:30 If you want to do something, because there's some, like, web exploitation, or…
13:51:36 Uh, binary exploitation, actually. You don't want to use your own computer,
13:51:40 Because you might break it. So that's why you've got to create a VM, work there,
13:51:44 to configure some stuff out.
13:51:45 Uh, my whole goal today is go… basically go through with you,
13:51:51 all the challenges.
13:51:54 Yeah. I already did it.
13:51:58 Like, I finish from 1 to 20,
13:52:01 But I want to go through again, how I would approach each problem, or, like, how to read it and understand it.
13:52:09 Um, let's see… yeah, all my codes are here. Alright.
13:52:13 On the way, you can follow me, or you can do it by yourself, keep working on it.
13:52:18 I don't have to listen what I'm saying, just sticky, I guess.
13:52:23 Elsa, what the fuck? Where's the people at?
13:52:26 Hello.
13:52:28 I'm gonna go online do I have?
13:52:33 Damn, I have warm people, one person.
13:52:36 All right. You guys suck at it.
13:52:38 Alright, alright. Um…
13:52:42 I see you guys saw the last email, I created… I announced, like, AI integration,
13:52:48 And I hope you did anybody follow up on that? I feel like nobody did, but that is okay.
13:52:54 Because the reason I wanted to do that, I can show you what I'm gonna do, so I'll do…
13:53:01 or open…
13:53:09 where you are…
13:53:17 Oh, wow, I must start.
13:53:19 All right. Basically, I am starting
13:53:25 Open Web UI, I'm not sure if you're sure of it.
13:53:29 is basically AI, right?
13:53:31 You guys know what AI is, I'm just using it in my own environment.
13:53:35 I want you guys to get hands-on experience on it.
13:53:38 That's the only reason I'm… I am…
13:53:40 giving you the staff, because it's important.
13:53:44 So you can say you did something with AI, because everybody cares about you're doing AI or not.
13:53:48 Uh, it's gonna… so, once you start everything, you can go local,
13:53:53 Wolf Cove…
13:53:56 local host.
13:54:04 So, it opens up this… oh, no, so that's what it is. Alright, so…
13:54:09 You'll have to register it, but I use a different browser, that's why it's not letting me to do it.
13:54:15 We're gonna do a different brother for here.
13:54:18 I'm gonna close this for a bit…
13:54:20 And then, open all here.
13:54:24 Discard…
13:54:26 Uh, slide…
13:54:30 Uh, this first slide, and local edit 8.
13:54:35 So I'm already here…
13:54:40 Huh. I know it's here, alright.
13:54:44 Basically, now it's running on your local machine, it can say, uh…
13:54:49 What's your…
13:54:53 What's your job?
13:54:54 And then my AI responds like this.
13:54:58 Hopefully, it will not break mine.
13:55:04 my computer, because it's a computer-intensive.
13:55:06 So, use your own say. So, it says…
13:55:10 Alright, I'm ready to Maduro branch into back here my language at that.
13:55:13 So, the chat that I shared with you guys, those are designed for solving specifically, like, capture the flag problems.
13:55:21 I want you to use AI to solve your problems if you don't know.
13:55:25 Yes.
13:55:31 The article that I shared with you, the link that I shared with you, tells you everything.
13:55:37 Huh?
13:55:39 Uh, are you in the group chat? Are you in the email?
13:55:44 You have… yeah, that's email. All the emails in there.
13:55:51 for the AI system?
13:55:52 You don't need it. Virtual machine, you need it eventually, but not for these purposes, or today's purposes.
13:55:58 Last time we set up. But…
13:56:00 I'm just showing you guys this skill, just be aware that you can use AI to solve it. That's the only reason I'm showing you.
13:56:08 Oh, Bender, it's Chafukurah, bended…
13:56:14 No, you don't. So that's what… that was the first lesson, right, we did.
13:56:19 So we're looking on board virtual machines. If you… if you're in the Discord, you'll get all the information there as well. Join the Discord.
13:56:25 Um, but…
13:56:27 So, coming back to the solo problems, right?
13:56:30 Who's… who finished number one?
13:56:33 or zero. I know you're finished. You were ahead. Don't raise your hand anymore.
13:56:37 Until we catch up to you. We could ever do it again, just tell us how you sold it, I guess, like, your process of thinking.
13:56:46 Who finished at number one, number two? Number one is kind of too easy to play.
13:56:54 Actually, hold on.
13:57:04 wanted to, let's say, can I connect to the…
13:57:08 Gonna connect through terminal…
13:57:35 Yeah, I think…
13:57:38 I'm gonna start working on starting from 2.
13:57:42 We're rich in this room, who's at number 2?
13:57:46 Okay, perfect. At least one.
13:57:53 Then, I hope it's the same password.
13:57:59 damn. Stinks.
13:58:01 I'm just gonna just go through quickly. Um…
13:58:04 Again, the… I will re-emphasize the purpose of today's class is to learn how to do this stuff, right?
13:58:12 It would be ambiguous, it would be hard, it will be all of it.
13:58:16 Uh, but before I do go to…
13:58:26 First one says, okay, your password…
13:58:30 You've been with Jira, and then…
13:58:34 I'm gonna be bound to the past with zero…
13:58:37 So yeah, alright.
13:58:39 have README…
13:58:41 So that's number one, that's the…
13:58:45 Alright, so we're gonna exit…
13:58:48 Gonna go back to number 1…
13:58:51 I'm just catching up to you guys, don't… I'm not explaining…
13:58:54 Because you guys already passed through this.
13:58:57 So…
13:59:02 Sudhu…
13:59:03 Wait, whose band is number one right now on their shell?
13:59:10 Tide pool is…
13:59:11 Who is… I know you got it.
13:59:14 Everybody's above number one?
13:59:16 Okay.
13:59:20 I would love them.
13:59:50 We can do this, this… Oh, here we go. Bye.
13:59:57 Yeah, so who's number 2 right now? It says number 2 on the con… on the terminal.
14:00:04 Uh, the plasma literature as well?
14:00:12 Okay?
14:00:15 So, CD, I mean…
14:00:28 Alright, who's at the Bandit 3?
14:00:31 Like, they're logged in as 3.
14:00:38 I wanted to move forward.
14:00:42 Alright, let's see what you're at, where you're at.
14:00:45 So, open your terminal.
14:00:49 So you're gonna do… do you know about SSH?
14:00:53 So, we'll do that.
14:00:56 Uh… they can just do SSH. Wait, hold on, you banded zero, yeah, you're already in.
14:01:02 Yeah, so do LS.
14:01:05 How did I read that thing?
14:01:09 How about you? Alright.
14:01:13 Damn boys. Alexa skin, tiny screen, it's smart.
14:01:16 Exactly. Basics for the job, um…
14:01:20 How about you? Are you number 3?
14:01:23 Um, for some time, I lost.
14:01:28 your code number? Yeah, that's what happened. That's why… this is…
14:01:32 By the way, I think…
14:01:34 Tell me, um, what's your problem now? Like, you tell me, what kind of problem you're facing right now?
14:01:49 Say that louder, one more time?
14:01:56 What he's trying to say, he lost the flat. That's what it is. You lost the flag to get into the next step.
14:02:02 That's why you need to have a good note-taking system. Have somewhere
14:02:06 you put your notes there.
14:02:08 Like, for me, for example, the way I solved it is that I start putting notes like this.
14:02:13 Like, 0 to 1, 2 to 3…
14:02:15 You need to have it, because…
14:02:17 you will forget, you will do a lot of commands.
14:02:20 That's why we put them somewhere that you have access 24-7.
14:02:25 Note-taking is very important in cybersecurity.
14:02:28 basically a career. Wanna be good in cybersecurity? Well, well, start taking notes.
14:02:33 Um, so, to everybody, it seems like on the 3 now.
14:02:38 Sure. Since you also have to start
14:02:42 Again,
14:02:44 Uh, let's see…
14:02:47 And if you have questions, let me know.
14:02:49 Because this is why I'm here.
14:02:54 Uh, I do 3 now…
14:03:04 CB…
14:03:26 Yes. I have, okay, I can, I can get to that.
14:03:34 It's right to, like, uh, save this?
14:03:37 Because it's just, like…
14:03:41 Because I think where Reset will go out.
14:03:45 No, you are, because… so what you did is that you entered this…
14:03:50 Um, you inside the CAT command.
14:03:53 Still, like, if you do something, it happens, like, weird thing. The way you cancel it, just, like,
14:03:59 See? Ctrl-C. What happened is that you just entered a command,
14:04:04 You know, IUCS?
14:04:07 Yeah, but I haven't taken the class. Gotcha. Basically, you're inside the loop, just circling around.
14:04:13 This one expecting some kind of command.
14:04:16 And that's what happens. So usually what happens with CTRL-C, it exits out.
14:04:22 So, try again. You're right, that's what you do, is the CAD file…
14:04:25 But if you don't know exactly, use ChatGPT to, like,
14:04:28 search it, because this is what I want to encourage everybody to problem-solving. It's not about just your brain using it to solve it.
14:04:35 for using resources you have to solve the problem.
14:04:38 And also, I understand why that works, not just like, oh, I sold no. Like, I understand why.
14:04:44 how they did it, what command they used, why they used it.
14:04:47 Just, like, not too much, but a little bit of understanding the basics.
14:04:51 I hear making voice above.
14:04:53 All right. Now, so…
14:04:57 Do you know about terminals and different terminals?
14:05:00 Okay.
14:05:02 So, look at this. Cause it.
14:05:06 Alright, so you're in already banned it, right? Perfect. What bandit are you on?
14:05:11 Zero? Okay. Go down.
14:05:14 So what you… and then do LS.
14:05:16 Wait, no, first start clear.
14:05:21 Yeah, press enter.
14:05:23 Alright, thanks. Do LS now.
14:05:25 Okay. Now, your README page, right? You need to read that. Do you know how to open a file?
14:05:32 path, and then…
14:05:35 Perfect. Well, it says.
14:05:39 That's your… copy that.
14:05:42 No, you copied it wrong. Copy it again.
14:05:46 The reason you did it wrong, you see, you see, you're grabbing the spaces.
14:05:49 You're grabbing the spaces. If you grab the space, it's gonna be wrong.
14:05:54 Alright.
14:05:58 Copy-paste, copy, yeah. And then exit.
14:06:02 Yep. And now, we're gonna go…
14:06:06 Arrow, top arrow.
14:06:08 And now you see you have 0, you're gonna change it to 1.
14:06:13 Enter.
14:06:16 And now, as password, what was the password again?
14:06:19 Exactly, you're gonna copy-paste it.
14:06:22 Press Enter.
14:06:27 You copy it wrong, so make sure you don't get spaces, so there's… look at the front, I think you're getting front.
14:06:34 How about you? You good?
14:06:38 You got it. Now, Duquette.
14:06:44 I'm a freshman. I don't even see the pass.
14:06:47 notes. Put in your notes. Like, that's what I was telling you guys, you're gonna… if you lose that thing, you have to go back.
14:06:53 So create a note to save it, make sure there's no…
14:06:56 spaces, or, like…
14:06:59 Hero, you got it. Yeah, exactly, it helps out.
14:07:05 Alright…
14:07:06 How's your thing going?
14:07:10 I know, it sucks.
14:07:11 How about you?
14:07:22 No, you press 8. Oh, you don't… oh, you can do that?
14:07:27 Because the lawyer?
14:07:33 There you go? You should stay alert, so I'm not gonna feel so bad.
14:07:39 So, Eva, thanks so much.
14:07:43 My friend got me a drink, because I am.
14:07:46 running a lot.
14:07:49 So, uh…
14:07:53 How many people do I have? Not even one anymore. Oh, well, it's only me now, so…
14:07:59 Yeah…
14:08:01 great turnout today, yeah…
14:08:03 Alright. Uh…
14:08:11 Alright, alright, and bam.
14:08:18 So, let's start solving the problem. Where am I now? So, I'm gonna bend it to you, right?
14:08:22 So, I'm also facing a problem here right now, but…
14:08:26 there's a hidden file, I need to open it, and I'm having a hard time opening it. Well, actually…
14:08:31 Not anymore.
14:08:33 process it, and got the answer.
14:08:38 So, again, it also…
14:08:40 It's about solving a problem. I think you guys got that part.
14:08:45 Really good. We're gonna make a competition end of the semester.
14:08:50 How are we gonna show up and do some stuff?
14:08:53 I was gonna do what…
14:08:55 Hey, if someone has to log out, that's pretty cool. I didn't know that.
14:09:02 I got the full band, so…
14:09:05 Gotcha.
14:09:12 Whoo! So?
14:09:15 Now, when you go 3, 2, 4, I think 4…
14:09:18 But… yeah.
14:09:24 The Barcelona nerves of some of the format, da-da-da-da…
14:09:31 One…
14:09:42 Yeah, I don't know.
14:09:45 I even forgot how to do it.
14:09:47 So it's a passport Nexo stored in a humanitable format in a hard drive. Alright, so…
14:09:53 These, uh, files?
14:09:56 We're gonna do, I think, forward.
14:10:02 How do I do it? So, perfect example, right? Like, okay, you start, you try to test your knowledge, and you're like, alright, let's go… let's solve this one. So you're gonna go…
14:10:11 I don't know what you guys use, but whatever AI tool you use, use it.
14:10:15 Uh, in order to use AI,
14:10:17 You have to specify
14:10:19 what it wants… what it needs to do, like, uh, tell them, you are…
14:10:25 TTF expert, and I am solving
14:10:29 Solving, and I need… and I need…
14:10:32 Your help.
14:10:34 Here's the issue.
14:10:37 Here's the challenge.
14:10:42 Here in the… I cannot see it right now, so I'm just…
14:10:46 clobbering. Don's, and…
14:10:50 also explain how to work.
14:10:54 How it works…
14:10:58 So, once you give the thing, it doesn't… it does a thing, right? It's a waste of energy, don't get me wrong, but, like,
14:11:05 Hey, that's how you learn nowadays.
14:11:31 All right, so it tells you, like, okay.
14:11:34 So you do this, and then…
14:11:38 Finally, to my next special relationship, file 7, whatever file name identifies their title.
14:11:44 I actually learned how to work, right? Like, what it does, what it's doing.
14:11:46 So, I was right, but…
14:11:49 I'm doing it, but I'm not getting the SEL table, like…
14:11:58 When I do the…
14:12:02 fine. Oh, that's why I'm using the wrong command, if I do the file, that's fine.
14:12:07 And then it gives you…
14:12:19 So I was like, alright, so I wanted your file gave me error, so I'm gonna say,
14:12:23 Uh, when I do a file, I'm…
14:12:26 getting…
14:12:28 I am getting…
14:12:31 This…
14:12:33 error. Ta-da!
14:12:35 And then called it pasted, but it's like…
14:12:45 Waiting, waiting.
14:12:47 And it says, like, oh, adding this into workflow, expand the file name to everything, so it's gonna do files,
14:12:54 That's this.
14:12:55 And then pops up. And then this is it.
14:12:58 So what are we gonna do? We're gonna do cat…
14:13:02 Right.
14:13:04 Sometime a fix happens?
14:13:08 And they're kept.
14:13:11 Damn.
14:13:13 Alright, I think it's too many commands.
14:13:16 Oh, I gotcha!
14:13:19 That's my flag. We're gonna do exit…
14:13:24 Under…
14:13:27 5…
14:13:28 And what I post it here.
14:13:33 But you should also understand why we're learning a certain command, right? Like,
14:13:38 Every time when you have this kind of thing, think about, like, how are you gonna solve it?
14:13:43 by thinking, how can you use it in your own
14:13:46 your own issue. Let's say you have a file,
14:13:49 And you're trying to search it. What do you do? Are you gonna do a file, or you're gonna do find? So it's like…
14:13:55 just good knowledge to have that, so it teaches you how to do it.
14:14:01 And so, no, and… yeah.
14:14:03 I'll make another walk around.
14:14:05 It's overwhelming, and that's the whole purpose.
14:14:09 How are you doing?
14:14:12 Which one? Exactly, right? So…
14:14:16 How are you gonna solve… let's see, that's a problem, right? You cannot grab it. What are you gonna do next?
14:14:21 bought another one coming in.
14:14:23 So you… but you know out of your mind… you remember the commands.
14:14:29 Well, the ones, like, um, Brian, I know we…
14:14:31 Exactly. That's what we use.
14:14:34 be hired to help you out.
14:14:36 That's what I was telling you over there, like,
14:14:38 take that, copy-paste it,
14:14:40 and give the ChatGPT and say, hey, there's a problem, so how can I open this file?
14:14:45 And it gives me an answer, oh, give you a solution.
14:14:50 I want you guys to use your…
14:14:52 problem-solving approach here, instead of just, oh, I solved it.
14:14:55 Like, it's great you can solve it, but if you're like an expert, hey.
14:14:59 Hooray to you, but…
14:15:02 In that situation, I want you to develop your…
14:15:04 thinking of how you're gonna solve certain problems when you don't know how to do it, or what to do.
14:15:11 No, I'm just uncompressing YouTube. Yeah, there's… I worked on yesterday, it took a bit.
14:15:16 It's, like, 8 times, 10 times on this? Yeah, it's annoying.
14:15:22 How are you doing?
14:15:25 So, let me help you out a little bit here, right?
14:15:31 what's something not clear in your eyes?
14:15:35 Like, what's the problem that you're facing right now?
14:15:40 Identify the problem first, like, what's a problem?
14:15:46 Yes.
14:15:49 So, if you go up…
14:15:51 So that's the problem, right? Like, and you don't know, you don't want to go open every single of them, right? That's a problem.
14:15:57 You wanna take it. So now…
14:15:59 Does the command to give you as a hint, you see, as a hint of how to do it 3 to 5, yeah, so now…
14:16:04 I want you from level… oh, the password to…
14:16:10 to the fine, copy, paste, copy.
14:16:14 from the command to here.
14:16:18 Oh, it sounds out.
14:16:19 It's… slide deck's described in the copy.
14:16:23 So, now, so that's the problem, right? Like, this is the problem, and what you're gonna do…
14:16:28 You're gonna do… do you have ChatGPT?
14:16:31 Uh, I have on…
14:16:33 Yeah. Oh, somewhere else.
14:16:37 So…
14:16:39 tell what's your problem? Say, I don't… describe what you're struggling with.
14:16:46 Did we want to just, like…
14:16:48 How many things going? No, describe, like, problem. What's your struggling?
14:16:55 I think you said exactly need to protect that.
14:17:03 No, no, no, don't do that. Just the thing that you just told me.
14:17:07 What did you tell me?
14:17:16 You told me, like, there's a… there's a file that one of them has password. I don't know how to find a password.
14:17:39 No, stop. Should not have done that.
14:17:42 So, think about you using it to solve the problem that you're facing.
14:17:46 And the way I'm just teaching you this framework, how to think about it, right? You're gonna describe how to find a
14:17:52 At the point passed in a group of files.
14:17:54 Uh, you… and now you have to give them what the context. Like, that's the primary goal.
14:17:59 You should give them context. Like, say, I'm doing CTF,
14:18:03 I'm doing CTF, at least something.
14:18:06 Put it down.
14:18:08 Okay, I'm doing CTF.
14:18:14 And then copy, paste it, and say, like, here's a challenge.
14:18:22 And cover bases.
14:18:25 And then set.
14:18:28 now what you did is that you tell them what was the problem, what the context, like, where to look at it.
14:18:34 And ChatGPT have the… and then the…
14:18:37 And then, like, what was instruction from original?
14:18:39 I was thinking for you, like, it's a way of problem approaching.
14:18:44 Who was that? Alright. Hell yeah.
14:18:48 How's… how are you going?
14:18:52 struggling to work? Do you need help with anything?
14:18:56 Great, nice, nice.
14:19:00 Yes, the funky.
14:19:04 It'll work for any, like, weird characters.
14:19:09 Yeah, technically, yeah. So, what do you… I learned that yesterday, too, that's why I like teaching, because I learned myself.
14:19:14 It's a thing, turns out you just command.
14:19:17 So, every time when you have… that's a command line.
14:19:22 tools. The command line has their flags.
14:19:25 So, when you do dash, it's a flag, thinking something else.
14:19:28 But if you dot things… oh, no, it's not a flag, it's a command I want you to do, open it.
14:19:33 And that's what happened.
14:19:44 That's a good one, actually.
14:19:52 Yeah, you see?
14:19:55 Did it give you the right answer? Like…
14:19:57 cause enough answer.
14:20:00 Okay.
14:20:02 Always go the simplest one all the time.
14:20:05 Quick and simple, always for that.
14:20:19 You got it?
14:20:21 It doesn't seem to be a VIN for a tech director.
14:20:27 No, this is a very tricky one. So what you're gonna do, you're gonna do LSLA, do LSLA.
14:20:36 Yeah, so look at… wait, no, no, no, no, go back to your home directory.
14:20:41 LSI.
14:20:43 And you see the SSH.
14:20:45 Yeah. That's your key, I think that's how you go through?
14:20:49 Is that what you're saying, anyway? Yeah, so for this level…
14:20:53 No, I've already, like… Are you in there? Dude. Like, I've SSH'd from Bandon 13. Ah, okay, you did already, you're in there.
14:21:00 you in the HS14 now.
14:21:03 Right? Yeah, I'm at 14. Yeah, dude, then… do cat. HC, this one.
14:21:09 It's much easier, yeah.
14:21:12 Yeah, that's, like, a root level of cloud. It's better to…
14:21:18 I have to cover basically the list error from… I got it.
14:21:25 Yep. We were…
14:21:27 stuck anywhere? No, I just made it.
14:21:33 How are you doing?
14:21:37 Don't be discouraged. What's the problem? What's… what's the thing you don't understand?
14:21:43 So, um, back, that's…
14:21:44 Okay, so copy-paste the… the challenge.
14:21:53 the whole child, right? Alright, go back to the chat you had.
14:21:59 All right. So…
14:22:01 how I'm doing… see, no, no, no, no, no, go back.
14:22:05 deleted. You don't need it right now.
14:22:07 Just write down, say, I'm working,
14:22:10 On CTF Challenge.
14:22:17 Switching down.
14:22:19 the 60F1 bad standard.
14:22:21 Yeah, not very official app.
14:22:25 Not very easy to show that. That's right. And then…
14:22:28 Here's a challenge, how to solve it.
14:22:31 Me? No. Oh.
14:22:40 Again, you have this word, that's important.
14:22:41 Um, no, I'm just, like…
14:22:44 So far as a student defended from 0 to 20 today.
14:22:48 I also introduced a new concept of local LLMs.
14:22:52 Hopefully they get interested, they can build content up with you.
14:22:56 I specifically look upon, uh, fine-tuned for coding.
14:23:00 So I was like, oh, let's maybe do something.
14:23:03 Oh, I'm a thing.
14:23:04 If you really do understand what's happening there, and then you can solve that way.
14:23:08 Again, always go simple and quick. Don't do crazy stuff.
14:23:13 One of my old coworkers, uh, did you ever meet Cam?
14:23:17 I think the guy who's called a software engineer, right? What? The guy who did a lot of coding, right, for you guys? Yeah. He thought you. The guy that trained me.
14:23:27 Yeah. Um, he just reached out and was like, hey, Adam, um, I think I have a potential CTF team could be up together, that he used to be part of, so I might go join him and do that.
14:23:36 Right, it should do it. Yeah, it's a lot of work, but… I mean…
14:23:41 It's a fun time together, and then…
14:23:43 I imagine, uh, I always believe that, I think that's exactly playing a…
14:23:50 Um, any kind of game? Like, yeah, you did this, no, you did this.
14:23:55 through the remote, especially.
14:23:58 I mean, I think it's cool, too.
14:23:59 Um, John? I think I went through most abandoned.
14:24:03 I think a long time ago, when I was getting started.
14:24:07 Perfect style, that's fine. People are learning slowly.
14:24:12 Ooh, next lesson would be about…
14:24:14 Color Linux, I would have sent them out. That one.
14:24:17 color. Wait, no, no. That's crazy. Linux.
14:24:21 Just Linux, sorry. Hackerbox, I already introduced a… I put some seeds on it, but hey, start doing it.
14:24:27 The next class will be just all about that, like…
14:24:31 Yeah. Um…
14:24:33 I don't know if I need to work on how many… depending on how many social apps. I'm trying to work on the capital applied. Do you think she'll do it, even if it doesn't show up?
14:24:42 Am I gonna do it? No. I am. I'm saying, should I do it still not… like, was a…
14:24:48 Well, I think you should talk to them and see what they want to do, because, um, I, like, I still have my…
14:24:52 Do you remember when I did my presentation at, um…
14:24:57 Oh, I forgot. That was it?
14:25:01 Dartmouth? Dartmouth, yeah. So far away. I still have my slide shirt if you want me to present with those.
14:25:07 to them, teach them about, like, what tools we use on campus for cybersecurity and stuff, so… That's good.
14:25:12 I mean, I think it's less advanced than what you're doing here. Really catching a bunch of music! I mean, it depends on what… How's it, man?
14:25:20 It was going good, but I got class. This is fun, though. Yeah.
14:25:23 Show up.
14:25:25 Yeah. Ryan told your comment, never give you anything? That's crazy, man. Go join the UMass Involve.
14:25:34 And there's a website, damn it, you should have…
14:25:37 Same time, same here.
14:25:40 Not every Wednesday. Oh, every Wednesday and time, yeah.
14:25:43 Just like the first one? This is the second one.
14:25:47 She does. See you, Matt.
14:25:51 How is it?
14:25:54 Um…
14:25:57 Please do sound conversions?
14:25:59 Exactly, right? So, look, like, I can tell you now… I mean, I think… Yeah, so what's the… We have something else off the top of your head? No, TAR's the best one, too.
14:26:07 So it seems text decimal, so I can repeatedly compressed.
14:26:13 the creative directory template to work on resume matrix, just a little…
14:26:17 What do you… what they want as uncompress it?
14:26:20 like TAR XF.
14:26:22 do LS, hold on.
14:26:24 I'm trying to do this. So, do a cat?
14:26:27 CAD data, yeah. Okay, so what are you gonna do, um…
14:26:32 cheesy, I think. Yeah, so you're gonna do… rename it, I feel like? Yeah, I think you do need to rename. Rename it to see…
14:26:40 I mean, yeah, it is, like, data that…
14:26:43 PR, disease? Oh, okay. PZ1?
14:26:47 Google it, I don't know, usually…
14:26:51 Look at the chat. That's what the chat says.
14:26:54 And… Ah.
14:27:03 Just look at how to uncompress hecadecimal into…
14:27:08 Yeah, how to encompass heckadecimal.txt.
14:27:12 Because it's like, use your, like, why you're doing it and how you're doing it, basic explanation of the other kind. Yeah.
14:27:19 Exactly, that's a whole thing, that's a… you're gonna… if you go…
14:27:23 deeper, deeper, like, go bigger number, you're gonna get weird shit. I'm like, yo, crazy.
14:27:28 How are you? How are you?
14:27:34 We could have to keep a big one, that's a key.
14:27:37 Like, what's that mean?
14:27:40 How you going? Look at that, progressing slowly.
14:27:45 Perfect.
14:27:47 How about you? Struggling? Yeah, that's…
14:27:50 I did that a lot yesterday.
14:27:52 So, I can teach you a little cool thing here, like, when you go up,
14:27:57 Uh, we can do the same… we're gonna look up the same…
14:28:00 This one, where you know, how did you do this one, right?
14:28:04 but also this thing called 2D…
14:28:08 No…
14:28:14 Okay, that's not right. This one will go up this one.
14:28:18 Do you know how to remove all the null permission denied parts? Normally, that's… Oh, uh…
14:28:24 change mine? No, it's about the… it's in this one, remember the syntax there? I forget the syntax. Yeah, can you just Google it?
14:28:36 Can I go with this one? Copy-paste this one…
14:28:38 Yeah, this whole thing, yeah, too. Yep, that one.
14:28:42 And post, like, how…
14:28:44 right format for this, I guess, how to do this?
14:28:54 Go up.
14:28:55 That's what… that's what you do. No, no, that's…
14:28:57 So, yeah. So copy that now.
14:29:01 And go back to the thing, and replace that one.
14:29:21 Just type it in the user.
14:29:28 Oh, I switched it, it's a dev…
14:29:31 Flash, no. I was…
14:29:33 Yeah, I think he's back in. You got it.
14:29:36 Look at that! It's a thing that I learned. It took me a bit to figure out, too. Just a thing that the removal of permissions, because we don't have much permissions.
14:29:44 So it helps out, like, there's always… if there's so much error,
14:29:47 press down and see if it holds a problem.
14:29:50 Yeah, well…
14:29:54 Yeah, looks like a multi-smo now.
14:29:56 Is there, I think, normal? Always like that. I think it… that's just clubs in general, you know what I mean? Less people on campus now, that's…
14:30:04 farther from the first week of classes.
14:30:07 I didn't even online, man, nobody… I wonder if… let's see how many people there we have.
14:30:16 Wait, hold on.
14:30:19 Wow, zero!
14:30:21 That's alright.
14:30:23 What I'm gonna do is that I'm gonna take this video,
14:30:27 do speech analysis on it.
14:30:29 and improve my presentation skills.
14:30:32 That's a… that's a course of action on that.
14:30:36 Or do you know about, um, the store?
14:30:39 What? Do you not bought the stove?
14:30:44 It's amazing.
14:30:55 let's call Wapini, right?
14:30:58 Open the web view. I have not heard of that. Oh, it's amazing.
14:31:01 You know how LLM has really…
14:31:04 Oh, I'm not a shady interface. Yeah.
14:31:06 This one takes it top notch, so you can basically
14:31:10 for any of our model. It's around the Obama, basically, and you can…
14:31:15 interact with it. Oh, wow.
14:31:17 life and soul in one place. Yeah, and the crazy shit.
14:31:20 Is that because now if you can build in, parts built in,
14:31:25 Like… Very cool.
14:31:28 Check it out, bro, I've been using it.
14:31:31 But that, like, Black folks edited my stuff.
14:31:34 Also, you can load any LLM that's still homepage, get it downloaded.
14:31:40 Well, I'm so… I'm so annoyed that I don't have good processing power to do some shit. Yeah.
14:31:48 What do you want me to do, uh, to my slides one day?
14:31:52 For, like, what we use on campus.
14:31:54 And it's that kind of stuff.
14:31:58 Definitely. We're just… I'm… I'm just being more considerable, like…
14:32:01 how we, like, people are gonna…
14:32:04 Like, I don't want you to waste your time.
14:32:06 Yeah, I would ask them what they want. If they want to hear that, I'd be more to ask you if they don't give a shit, then…
14:32:11 Excellent, yeah. Um, then I… I just don't want to, like, places get people's fucking…
14:32:16 The ones that, like, hey, bring the speaker to us here. I'm like, what?
14:32:22 To waste of their time, no, right? We don't have much cultural yet, but wait, you know what I'm saying? We don't have consistently people.
14:32:28 You don't mean to ask them.
14:32:31 Huh? Tony asked them. I mean…
14:32:34 I know, I don't like… again, that's why I was, like, they're right here at the disaster.
14:32:43 Because we have, like, 50 people sign up now, you know?
14:32:46 Well, I think it's just people are not gonna come.
14:32:49 Because, you know, people sign up… like, that's what I did when I started.
14:32:52 Basically, you can set up for everything, and then, like, oh shit, I don't actually want to do this.
14:32:57 How can I make this one interesting? I think it's hella interesting. No, it's your fault. I think it's just…
14:33:01 This is how it works, yeah. Especially being in computer school, you know what I mean?
14:33:05 Wait, what school? Community? Like, most people here don't live on campus.
14:33:10 Like, you're gonna be you or something that pulls something else.
14:33:13 That's what defined difference, anything.
14:33:16 Huh, I did never cross my mind that. I always thought, like, just…
14:33:20 do not fucking like that, but it's about commuter school in 19th, but you're right.
14:33:26 Uh, who has questions?
14:33:29 Damn!
14:33:34 Yeah, again, it's a stock using that to help you out.
14:33:39 You know, I don't really need that.
14:33:41 really…
14:33:43 That's okay, yeah, I mean, it's a…
14:33:46 Yeah, I'm not gonna hold you back. Where did you go back to work? Yeah. Thanks for showing on with me. Yeah, no problem.
14:33:52 Yeah. Chilli, man.
14:33:54 It's, like, I get it, you don't want to use it, that's okay, but, like, it's…
14:33:59 The toll that, you know, disposal.
14:34:01 Amazing tool. Like, amazing tool.
14:34:04 I don't want to emphasize too much,
14:34:06 But that's how you can elevate your experience quicker and faster and more effectively.
14:34:11 get something done.
14:34:15 Especially Google's a powerful tool.
14:34:18 How you doing? Oh yeah, 13 now. 14.
14:34:27 Yeah, that's a normal going on.
14:34:29 And you cannot go anymore.
14:34:34 all the way down, but… How did… did… no, but you cannot.
14:34:39 Oh, it says if it's…
14:34:47 Did you do it? Yeah.
14:34:49 The voice? Yeah. Because I have to do manual every single time, and I'm like, wow, I get stuck in a bit. That's my… This is being characteristic thing, so…
14:34:59 No, hey, don't feel… guys, don't feel bad if you're in ChatGPT, like, you're not thinking. No, I don't. Yeah, just saying, it's your… Exactly, it's a tool, it's on your disposal. Use it to the fullest.
14:35:22 Yeah, so, yeah, I think…
14:35:24 That's what today is like submitting, for sure.
14:35:28 people didn't show up, or something, but hard work didn't pay out.
14:35:31 Because I made slides and all of those. I was going to teach you guys permission stuff, but oh well.
14:35:38 On me.
14:35:42 Uh, we have another…
14:35:45 5 minutes, technically, so we can just still keep solving it until we figure it out.
14:35:50 Again, I gave you the tools to solve it.
14:35:54 You don't need me anymore, you can basically solve everything.
14:35:58 Almost everything to show off the classification that you're most about.
14:36:09 How's your doing? Helping you out?
14:36:54 At least, my video check works really well.
14:37:04 This is just the beginning, guys. This is a basic and easy one.
14:37:08 The other stuff, which is much harder.
14:37:10 And that's why I wanted to introduce it.
14:37:12 I want to put you in an environment where you feel stressed out,
14:37:15 And you have no idea how the hell to approach it.
14:37:19 That's why I can tell you, welcome to CTF, that's why you're gonna feel every time when you sell on the CTF thing.
14:37:28 Did you get 20? No, I'm still on…
14:37:32 16. What's the 16 of a socket? It's about, like, it's about, like, it's about, like, figuring out which parts have, like,
14:37:39 It's user endmark. Right. NMUP.
14:37:44 You're gonna use Nmap.
14:37:47 Again, I do use ChatScript in other Google HubSpot better.
14:37:52 Wait, you charge $59 a month, because ChatGPT has the end up, um…
14:37:58 what command to use to get it. Does that make sense?
14:38:02 Or you don't use it on purpose. I feel like you don't use it on purpose.
14:38:06 normally, like, I also like this, like,
14:38:10 Hey! Someone who needed, like, the integrity of things.
14:38:14 All right, whatever…
14:38:17 What an interesting thing, man? What are…
14:38:19 And why you solve the problem. Just the problem is just problem… solving the problem.
14:38:24 But also, I just don't have a… That's crazy!
14:38:30 You're not joking, aren't you?
14:38:34 So, it's like that.
14:38:42 Alright, this is conclude our meeting, guys.
14:38:46 Thank you for your time. I'll let you go a little early. You can stay as long as you want here.
14:38:50 I'll be here for a bet.
14:38:53 I'll be here until 3…
14:38:56 4.
14:38:58 Yeah, I'll be here for a bit, so, you know.
14:39:07 Join if you must, or stay if you must.
