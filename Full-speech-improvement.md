Perfect. Clean split. Here's the final system:

**Daily Pen Reading (30 min)**
- Audio analysis only (new Praat/parselmouth tool)
- Focus: articulation metrics — Whisper confidence, formant spread, HNR
- Output: "Your weak words today were X, Y, Z. Jaw opening improved/declined."
- Pure mechanical improvement. No Gemini needed here — just data over time.

**Every Other Day: 5 Min Free Talk (video)**
- Three inputs merge:
  1. **You** — body language + voice (manual notes)
  2. **Speech analysis tool** — words, fillers, readability, structure
  3. **Audio analysis** — articulation metrics
- All three → Gemini → one unified actionable feedback

**Off days: Review**
- Read Gemini's feedback
- Pick ONE fix for next recording

**What's different from your old failed system:**
- Topic problem solved — use any topic + Category 2 framework
- Analysis → action gap closed — Gemini bridges data to specific drills
- Articulation actually measured now — not just word-level

**This is the complete design.**
