      "text": "Apples and oranges, a comparison.  So what makes the difference?  What separates the young, the new rich,  characterized, characterized,  is often from the end of the July to find a life  hasn't touched them by.  It begins at the beginning.  The new rich can be separated from the crowd  based on their goals.  Which are like very distinct priorities  and life philosophies.  So philosophies.  Not a subtle difference in voting  to both the change in the necessary actions  for building what at a goal and at the end of the system  are goals.  They are not limited to business owners.  Even deeper, I will show later why to employees.  G. To work for yourself.  To how other work for you.  G. To work when you want.  And to further work for workers sake  into the minimum necessary for the maximum effort.  Minimum effort loads.  To retire early or young.  To distribute the coveted periods in a venture.  Minimum retirement.  To the life in a local base.  And it's not the inactive it is not the goal.  Doing what which is attached to is.  To buy all the things you want to have.  To do all the things you want to do.  And be all the things you want to be.  Is this includes some tools.  And like that.  And at the end of all bonuses.  Not the focus.  To be the boss instead of the employee.  To be in charge.  To be either.  Need to the boss.  Know the employee.  What's the owner.  To own the trains.  And have.  Someone else ensure their line on time.  To make time money.  To make the time money with.  And define the time line.  And that's included.  What are you working for.  To have more.  To have more quality.  To have more quality and less.  To have huge financial.  For recognize that the most material wants.  I just equation for.  Spending time on the things that.  Really and not a matter.  Including buying things and preparing to buy things.  It's been two weeks, negotiating your new.  I'm ready with a dealership.  Do us have been good.  10,000 of.  That's great.  There is a life of a purpose.  Are you contributing anything useful.  to this, this, this, this, this world, all that suffering data, banging on keyboard and coming home to the junk and existence on the weekend.  To reach the big fair of whether I feel acquisition with time and or other other other part of gold comes every day.  The first of all, first, this, pay the second. To have freedom from doing the wish you decide.  To have freedom from doing what you would like, by over the freedom and resolve to pursue your dreams without reverting to work or work state.  After a year, the refrigerator will often need to be harder to find your own passions, to define your dreams and to revive hobby and let's add up a third year extinction.  The goal is not to simply eliminate the bad, which does nothing more than leave you with a vacuum.  But to pursue and experience the best in the world.  Getting us the wrong train, the first principle that you must not to be fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool.  Enough, enough, enough is enough, learning, no more, learning, no more.  The blind quest for cash is a full, full turn.  Oh, yeah, I cannot see this.  I have talked at private plans over and enjoyed many of the best ones in the world.  I have talked at one in the world, between the world class.  The world is like kings, London, white and beautiful, the world is beautiful.  It's all cost less than rent in the year.  You want to free your time allocation.  Your month is automatically worth 3, 3, 3, 3, 10 times as much.  This is nothing to do with currency.  It's being financial, rich and highly in the bill to really like a million year of fundamental to the different things.  Money is multiplied in practical value, depending on the number of W's you control in your life.  What do you do?  What do you do?  What where?  You do it in which home you do it.  I call the freedom multiplier.  You think this is a criterion.  You think this is a criterion that 80 hours per week, 50, 400 million per year in a thousand per year.  The investment branch is less powerful than for you in our world.  One and a half hours for the 40,000 world class, complete freedom of war and war and hard to wait.  The former one may be the world's worth less than 40, 40,000 in the latter and the latter in the latter.  That's the end of the latter for a thousand worth more than 500,000 when you run the number 500, 500,000.  Look at the lifestyle, the output of the money.  The ability to choose is real power.  This will give you all about how to use and create both options with the risk effort and cost.  It doesn't happen paradoxical, but you can make more money, a lot more money by doing half of what you are doing now.  Who are they?  Who the fuck are they now?  Who are they?  They are the people who really arrange the schedule and appreciate the multiple achievement, achieve one person of the results and one tenth of the time,  which frees into practice, cross-country skiing and take road trips with the family two weeks per month.  They've been torn to eliminate the risk for the world's customer and protect us, as well as all the operation entirely,  and throughout the world, targeting redactments all while working in the Muslim world that should get their own illustration worth.  The student will also elect the risk at all, which is nothing to establish in an online video rental service.  The older 500,000 per month in income from a small needs a very nice noise and true hours, true hours per week side products are lost and to work fully,  after I know all the rights to love you.  Just as our limitless which past begins with the same first step replacing assumption, during the moment you will need to wear a new electric one and re-collaborate, re-collaborate direction using a compass for the unusual world,  world, world, world,  from investing responsibility to just stunning the entire concept of success, need to change the road.  Oh shit, I was pretty bad, I was jagging, oh my god, let's put that to 10, no, I don't know  that, that's not really bad, let's fight back to 10.  New players for the new game global and I was 60, learned a lot like a well-trained  based on luck and others. Accelerated 360, 360, 360 to 360 to 3, 360, 360 to 3, 360 to 3,  air to the thinning noise turned the sun still begins to miss the liquid to wrackfully  first of the fuse curtain X over his head and landed in the record books as he fly across  the fence. There was a restriction in 2006 and he was now a mogul skiing gold medal that  was approaching winter Olympics. Unlike other folks that might say he will never have to turn  to a dead end doubt after his moment of glory. No, will he look back at his day as the climax of his  only passion. After all, he was only 21 years old and drove a vast lumber journey. Born Canadian  and something of great boomer Delphanse is calling an Internet based IT company at the age of 13.  Fortunately, he had a media experience mentor and passionate to drive him. His particular  father, Dave Sinclair, the first guy doing outstanding on top of the Olympic podium,  he would own three years later become the third largest company in the world.  While Delph's teammates were hitting the floor for the next session, he was often  weren't safe for clients in Tokyo. The world of hard work, not smarter,  becomes a fact that his coach itself was spending too much time on his business and not  rather than two between his business or his dream, Delph also moved a little bit more from  either towards and then he wasn't spending too much time on his business. He and his  brother were spending too much time with Canada. In 2002, the most skier captain of the world,  Charlotte, where the team was smaller and more flexible and coached by a legend.  Three or three years later, his business went head-to-head against a former teammate and became  the third Aussie in history to win their gold. In the land of Wallabies and big surf, Delph  has gone porcelain, literally right now, through the evil, partly  comment, comment, or the addition, you can buy stamps with your fees on them.  Fame has spurred us to start looking outside the choices presented to you. They are always  ledger options. Once you're safe, you're going to settle for a second, that happens to you in life.  That's what happens to you in life. That will remain conditioned so that there's every  more money that will make things right. They go our every turn, we're in target of  30,000 to 1 million in the profile and 10,000. No, 100,000 a year is 50,000. As an accessory,  do we go in a realistic sense, come back with the same number of children. See how it lasts.  I can't do it. I don't know why I can't do it.  And I am, I just don't get it.",

      "text": "Hello, today's topic is one of guess winter blizzards.  Right now I'm in Northeastern of U.S., and we are experiencing a blizzard.  This is one of the few times we had blizzards since 2015, so it might set a new record of  how much snow will have in the city at the end of it.  Things about blizzards that I didn't know, number one, blizzards are unexpectedly fast.  I know, it seems like what blizzards mean something, but if you never experience it, you  really don't know what the blizzard is.  So, when I heard it's a blizzard, I thought to myself, winter, that was my idea, but  and today morning I walked out and opened the window, opened the door, and I was like,  holy fuck, this is blizzard.  First I understood what the blizzard means in the context of living and seeing.  Second, it's really windy, I would not expect that to be that much wind.  I expect it to be just a lot of snow nonstop, but what makes it worse is just wind, it's  not just wind, it's a gust of wind from, no, left to right, side to side, up and down  to it.  It is crazy.  When you look at it, you're like, wow, that's the wind, and you can visibly see it because  of snow goes with it, and you're like, wow, that's wind, I knew what the wind is by on  a blizzard term, it's hard to, it's really impressive, and third one, how are we all fucked?  Despite cities having, at least my city having constant, big vehicles that are clearing  the roads, I forget what's the name of it, but big trouble or an oompsh, can open the road,  right?  They've been working since last night, and then it doesn't look like they've been  doing shit, because the roads are already snowed like that, you don't see the road, you  just see that snow piled up that up, I'm like, wow, that's crazy, and they think we're  going to drive tomorrow, I don't know, so, that despite all the resources that our city  put it in, to keep the, probably the, to go roads are working as, as roads, it seems  like hard to do, because the snow is going south, has already piled up, soft up, you're  like, wow, there's no wake, I'm not the shit, I'll remove it, it is crazy how snowy we  are, there's a two type of blizzard, there's a lot of type, but I want to talk on the two,  number one is the mountain blizzard, blizzard is basically the same thing, but much more extreme  in the mountains, obviously, this fact, not that much interesting, but it's good to know  that, oh, we have mountains and mountains, can have their own blizzard timing, and we have  specifically, the second time is a specific four northeastern, there's a northeastern  cycle blizzard, it means that it's just a big cloud from cyclone basically, comes in  and just swaps area, creating blizzard conditions, and making it impossible to live, and it's crazy.  One more thing that I really want to emphasize today is that, we talk about winter or  blizzard, or we know it, you heard of it, you understand the definition of it, but if you  never experience it, really, you don't know what it is, like, sometimes we complain sort  of stuff, but in order to really tell, to really show that we know something, we have  to experience some degree, like, I think there's a big difference between understanding the  world's or concept behind it, but also experiencing it is completely different. The same way I  felt buffled by the blizzard, the experience of having a blizzard weather right now, it just  blew my mind, that is all, bye.",

Okay, she reclined in her seat and glanced across the aisle, back her sleeping  husband. Marked count and she had done 1000, 1000 of times. One, two, three. So far, so good.  In two hours, they would all be back in Paris, safe and sound. That was assuming to play  from New York, Virginia held together, of course. New Caledia nestled in the tropics  of Coral Sea, New Caledina, was a French territory and a Julie and Mark had just rolled to say about that  took them 1500 miles around the world. Of course, recouping the initial investment  had been part of the plan. All said and done the 15-month exploration of global. From the  gondola, which waterways of Venice to the tribal shores of Malaysia, had cost them between  18,000-19,000 less than rent and regarded in Paris. Most people have considered this  impossible. Then again, most people don't know the more than 30 families set sail from  France each year to do the same. The trip had been a dream for almost two decades,  located to the back of the line behind and ever growing list of responsibilities. Each passing  moment brought a new list of reasons for putting it together. One day Julie realized that  if she didn't do it, now she would never do it. The realization, legitimate or not,  would have just continued to add up and make it harder to convince herself to escape once possible.  One year or one year of preparation, one to do the trial run, which a husband waited  to set sail on a trip of lifetime. Julie realized almost as soon as the anchor  left that far from being a reason not to trial and seek adventure. Children are perhaps  the best reason for all to do both. Pretty true, her true voice had sought like  barges at the drop of the head. In the process of learning to call this in the  floating bedroom, to learn patience, as much as for themselves, as for the sanity or their  parents. Pretty, pretty books were about appealing as eating sand, given the alternative of  staring at a wall on the open sea. All three learned to love books, pulling them out of  school for one academic year and exporting them new environment high, proven to be the best  investment in their education to date. Now sitting in the plane, Julie looked at the  cloud as the wing caught past to them, already thinking of their next plans to find a place  in the mountains to ski all year long, and using income from all-sellering walks up to find  their slopes and more chowel. Now she had done it once, she had it.  A large style in design and inaction. A large style design inaction. Others is done with  driving across town to collect my son from childcare, only to slide across. I see highways trying  to get back to work with him in tow, in tow to finish my work. My mini retirement brought  us both to live in alternative boarding school full of creative lifestyle, redesigning children  and start in a gorgeous order for us, with spring fed ponds and plenty of sunshine. You can  easily search for alternative of school or traditional schools that might accept the children  during your stay. Alternative schools often see themselves as supportive communities.  To us supportive communities and are exceptionally welcoming, you might even find an opportunity to  work at school where you could experience, could experience a new environment with your child,  team or somebody else. Rules that change the rules. Everything popular is wrong. I can give you  a surefire formula for success, but I can give you a formula for failure. Try to please everybody  all the time. American entrepreneurs, business entrepreneurs, everything popular is wrong.  The importance of being earnest. Building the game, not playing the game. In 1999, sometimes  after quitting my second unfulfilling job and eating peanut butter sandwich for comfort,  I won the gold medal at the Chinese boxing International Championship. It wasn't because  I was good at it, pointing and kicking. God forbid, the symptoms of being dangerous considered  I did it on a dare and had four weeks of preparation. Besides, this side, I have a watch at  the bottom of my head. It's a big target. I won by reading the rules and looking for an exploited  opportunity of which there were two. Way in was the day prior to competition.  In the competition technique commonly practiced by elite power lifters and Olympic  wrestler, I lost 28 pounds. Our pound in 18 hours, weighing at 1.65 pounds and then  dehydrated back to 193 pounds. I started to fight someone from the three way class above  you for the guy. There was a technicality in the fine print. You won't come but sell  off the elevated platform three times in a single round. He was born by default. I decided  to use this technicality as my principal technique and place people off. You might imagine  this did not make the judge and the happiest Chinese out of the scene. The result, the result,  the result, I won all of my matches by technicality call and national champion, something  99 with 49 years of experience had been unable to do it. But in pushing people out of the  ring, pushing the boundaries of ethics, not at all. It's not more than doing the uncommon  within the rules. The important distinction is that between official rules and self-employed  rules, can I do for example, from the first website of Olympic movement? Okay, I'm done.",

      "text": "Hello, today we are going to talk about socks, not that you suck, no, no, that's different.  Sucks, a thing that you wear, I wish I was flexible and to show like this way you put  the socks on.  Actually, I'm flexible.  Let's do it.  Okay, that's so you put the socks on.  That's crazy, right?  I want to talk about three things.  Sucks has a thing about them that is we don't much discussed.  First thing, socks, socks, right?  A piece of clothes that we wear on our little toes, our legs, our foot, and that gives  us very comfortable.  Have you ever been in a cold environment and when you put the socks on, it feels so warm?  Our foot is a little sensitive that we're there to meet, so socks, socks, socks, I don't  know how to say it properly, helps a lot to give you warmth.  Second thing is that socks allows us to move faster by letting us to wear shoes.  Have you ever wear, well, we can say shoes are protective layers, foil legs, basically  have you ever wore or tried to wear protective clothes, which is shoes, was on a socks.  It will destroy your legs.  It's not necessarily that people cannot come up with shoes, was out as socks, but socks  allows mobility, functionality, take it off and take it off, and comfort.  That's it.  There are two types of socks.  Well, let me clarify that by that one can argue, there's a billion types of socks, which  is true, but I generally think there's only two socks, ankle, size, socks, and above  the ankles, so basically the socks one only goes up to ankle, and there's a socks that  goes beyond that ankle, and I think there's a lot of different between them, but that's  what it is.  And the core idea behind the socks that we discussed today isn't just hit the piece of  wear, but it's how sensitive we are on our legs, and how much it gives us comfort.  I wonder to or propose to ask, I would like to propose a question, who in your life is  that person who is your socks, who's your sock, not socks, sock, I repeat, my question,  who is in your life, who would describe, you describe them as your sock, sounds  around, but it has a different meaning, because when we have this comfort on our legs, we  feel happy, we feel encouraged, we feel comfortable, and I bet there's a people who can  also, in that metaphor, make our life happy, more comfortable, so I think socks, we don't  think about it, we don't discuss as much, but they are very useful in the resemblance  our friendships and our relationships, there are people around us, so when you're thinking  about how much you like the other person, or show the gratitude, how much you appreciate them.  Tell them that they are your socks, the comfortable socks that you wear on the winter cold days, have  a winter, that's why, all days that you find yourself seeking for comfort and warmth,  and they just, in there, you forgot, in the moment you pull it out, in the moment, slide  it in, it feels warmth, comfort, and ease, that it's all today, bye.",
