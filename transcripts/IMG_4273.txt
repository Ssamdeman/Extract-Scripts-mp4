Hello, today we are going to talk about sucks.
Not that you suck.
No, no, no, that's different.
Sucks.
The thing that you wear.
I wish I was flexible and to show like this way you put the sucks on.
Actually, I'm flexible.
Okay.
That's so you put the sucks on.
That's crazy, right?
I want to talk about three things.
Sucks has a thing about them that is we don't much discussed.
First thing sucks sucks, right?
A piece of clothes that we wear on our little toes, our legs, our foot, and that gives us very comfortable.
Have you ever been in a cold environment and when you put the sucks on, it feels so warm?
Our foot is a little sensitive that we're there to admit.
So sucks sucks sucks.
I don't know how to say it properly helps a lot to give you warmth.
Second thing is that sucks allows us to move faster by letting us to wear shoes.
Have you ever wear, well, you can say shoes are protective layers, foil legs.
Basically, have you ever wore or tried to wear protective clothes, which is shoes, was on a sucks.
It will destroy your legs.
It's not necessarily that people cannot come up with shoes without Sucks.
But sucks allows mobility, functionality, take it off and take it off.
And comfort.
That's it.
There are two types of sucks.
Well, let me clarify that by that everyone can argue.
There's a billion types of sucks, which is true.
But I generally think there's only two sucks.
Ankle, Sucks, and above the ankles.
So basically, the sucks one only goes up to ankle and there's a sucks that goes beyond that ankle.
So I think there's a lot of different between them, but that's what it is.
And the core idea behind the sucks that we discussed today isn't just hit the piece of clothes of wear, but it's how sensitive we are on our legs and how much it gives us comfort.
I wonder to propose to ask, I would like to propose a question.
Who in your life is that person who is your Sucks?
Who is your Suck?
Not Sucks.
Suck.
I repeat.
My question.
Who is in your life?
Who would describe?
You describe them as your Suck.
Sounds so wrong, but it's...
It has a different meaning.
Because when we have this comfort on our legs, we feel happy.
We feel encouraged.
We feel comfortable.
And I bet there's a people can also, in that metaphor, make our life happy, more comfortable.
I think Sucks, we don't think about it, we don't discuss as much, but they are very useful in the resemblance our friendships and our relationships with people on us.
So when you're thinking about how much you like the other person or show the gratitude, how much you appreciate them.
Tell them that they are your Sucks.
The comfortable Sucks that you wear on the winter cold days have a winter, that's why.
All days that you find yourself seeking for comfort and warmth.
And they just, in there, you forgot.
And the moment you pull it out, the moment slide it in, it feels warmth, comfort and ease.
That is all today.
