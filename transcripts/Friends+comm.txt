People who can't communicate think every disagreement is an argument.
People who lack accountability take every piece of feedback as an attack.
And people with little to no self-awareness see every boundary as betrayal.
The truth is that most people aren't reacting to you.
They're reacting to what they refuse to face within themselves.
Your clarity feels like confrontation.
Your honesty feels like judgment.
Your standards feel like abandonment.
But don't let any of that make you shrink.
Don't confuse their discomfort with your wrongdoing.
The right people won't flinch at your feedback.
They won't fear your boundaries.
They won't run from accountability.
They'll rise with you.
Because at a certain point it's not about being liked.
It's about being an alignment.
And when you're in alignment, you don't argue to be understood.
You just live in a way that can't be misread.
Stay solid.
Let them meet you there.
Or fall off trying to figure out why they couldn't shake you.
