Hello, horrible.
Today we're going to talk about a prompt that I came from Chatcha Piti or Claudia.
I don't like to use more Chatcha Piti as a broader term for older, a lot of language
model because Chatcha Piti isn't that great.
And I think the best one, my opinion, personal, is Claudia or Claudia.
Hello, it's me, Tocco.
So today's topic is what's the skill that you wanted to learn but never got to learn?
We all have that kind of regrets.
It's very common.
And the one thing for me that got away from my arsenal was articulation words.
On young age, I knew that my language wasn't my strongest.
It wasn't my strength.
It was my weakness.
I knew it.
Everybody knew it.
I can hear myself every day like, damn, I'm just bad at it.
Of course I broke some degree.
I read more, I wrote more.
I know all of the stuff, but there's one skill I realized I should do on the young age,
which is articulation.
And the way you train for better articulation is the movement of your mouse.
Again, I have a huge accent and that's another way to reduce down your articulation.
So in order to get better or better words is to practice or do some techniques such as
hand in your mouse and you read it.
I'll show you.
I cannot put this in my mouse right now because I need to wipe it.
Everything just your mouse needs to be sterilized.
So, this scale I got away from you already.
What you do is to take this, put your mouse, do your bike on it and try to talk.
It makes your mouse feel a lot of weirdness, but it opens up certain words and makes it just
more movement of your mouse or any mouse.
So, the whole thing is now, I know, I know, I look ridiculous, but now I can read.
Why do I, I chose to read the book finally.
Finally, I'm talking 500 pages.
Four things is this is E5, how it kept.
I did like a 3D, I guess, and then I dropped.
I'm going to X Y. That's probably one of my regrets.
Okay, now you can keep me better.
Well, actually, maybe putting that thing makes me sound much better.
Anyways, this, that thing basically just, not practicing this scale, made me basically,
I believe, much more.
I'm using, I'm seeking for a word, but I cannot find it.
It made me, not doing the scale, the scale practice made me more gibberish, based on people's
description, rambling a lot, bad pronunciation, and most importantly, misclowny, kitcht.
There's always two routes when it comes to improving this kind of LA.
There's always two decisions you can make when it comes to discount scales that you forgot to do in the past.
Now you realize now you should have that it.
So first path is to say, fuck it, and do all, that means, focus on different things.
Well, second path, be like me, start again.
It's never late to start, and that's what I'm going with, is a second path.
I regret it. I definitely do, but it does make sure to stop it.
I need to keep going, keep running, and keep doing the shit.
So now I know exactly, never enough to do the shit.
Bye.
