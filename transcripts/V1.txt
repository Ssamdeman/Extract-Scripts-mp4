This is my 5 minute video about my speech.
The subject today I'll be talking is my ability not able to deliver a good speech.
Yes.
What inspired or transpired last time about my directly touched my communication skill was
an event I was presenting a project that I worked on and I for the entire time I thought it was fine.
I did not see any kind of issue.
Yes, there was some moments that I felt like I was reiterating or repeating.
But I didn't see that big of an issue.
Turns out based on my coworker who was next to me when I was given the presentation gave me a clear feedback that it wasn't great at all.
I was stuttering.
I was repeating myself again and again.
The one line took me off was that English is not your first language.
I know.
It is the truth.
But I don't want to be associated with that kind of manners at all.
I don't want anybody to claim or believe or think that our English is not my first language and it hinders my ability to speak.
Even if it's my second language, you should not prevent me to speak.
Well, and this is what I'm trying to do here.
Trying to improve on my speech.
I do not get angry and say, no, you're wrong.
I honestly received that feedback and processing it to make sure that I know why they said things they said not just to...
Oh, they said because of Joe's, so they didn't present.
No, they have a valid point.
I'm listening and I'm working on it every day.
I do make a 5-minute video talking about certain stuff.
I still don't have my voice.
My voice hurts a little bit, but I'm keep going.
See how it goes, right?
I want you, I want to listen to myself later and how I sound like and whatever.
But I'm so frustrated that other people can tell that I'm really bad at speaking.
They can visibly observe that I've done my English, that my English is not my first language.
And that's annoying.
It's a frustration because I'm also hard to be better.
And I cannot tell them I'm better because I cannot deliver the basic communication skill to them to say, hey, I can speak.
And not to have them idea, oh, shit, this guy.
English is not their first language.
That's in my personal experience.
It's humiliating.
But, and I will learn, we'll live and learn.
What's the speeches all about, right?
Communication matters a lot.
It makes us presenting.
I want to present myself to people down great.
Sometimes hard.
But I want to fail presenting myself due to circumstantial evidence, circumstantial events or circumstantial manners is that of me being unable to communicate well.
That's the goal.
And how long have left?
It's been four minutes now.
I've had time goes fast when you start speaking.
I hate to listen to this video.
I look crap for sure.
And I'm going to say tomorrow and see how I do and will experience about this video.
And then I'll keep doing more and more.
For sure, I'll make a better structure of talking.
I just don't know what else to talk except just to talk.
I can see how I basically think about it and how my language and my visuals are like, what are the RFI?
