Today, I want to talk about running as a mean of putting one step to another on the solid ground.
Running is a very interesting concept. A lot of people hate it, but a lot of people also love it.
You can also define people in two ways. People who love it, who hate it.
I am, who loves it. A little background about myself is that I always love running.
It was kind of my element. I thought swimming was my element, but when I had a purchase win, I didn't.
Over the time, I didn't give up running the same way I gave up on swimming.
It really showed me that there's a, oh, I want this, but there's also, oh, this one doing.
Running was accepting that I always want to run, and in terms of that, I'm just a runner. I run.
Running, it seems for many people hard, and it is.
I think one of the reasons is hard is that because two reasons first will be mental, second physical exhaustion.
What I mean by mental is that when you're running, you buy yourself.
There's nothing else to do except just keep moving forward, just keep moving forward.
And nothing else. Yes, you can find music. Yes, you can just track yourself by listening music.
And in the meantime, you're constantly running.
And some people can't take it because your body goes through so many changes while running.
It makes it uncomfortable. It makes it feel weird. You don't want to be in that position.
It's not just sitting normal, I guess, all laying down, just like being yourself.
Running changes you, takes you out from your comfort zone.
And the physical exhaustion also, it's next, the physical exhaustion makes a lot of people discouraged.
Running takes a lot of toll on your body because you're moving most of your muscle, including your brain.
When you're running, you don't feel it in the first two seconds.
And then after like five, ten seconds, you're like, fuck, I hate this.
And that's the reality of it because it's physical exhaustion.
What makes the run so hard?
But at the same time, if you think about it, physical exhaustion can be for anything.
But if you make your body to adapt the run of physical exhaustion, you'll get better.
And that's one of the things that a lot of people are not going to do.
And I understand why. It's hard, it's challenging. You don't feel comfortable.
When I start running, I hit it to run in a way like, oh, fuck, it hits.
It's so much pain, literally physically pain and mental pain before and after.
But I learned that, but I learned that despite reasons why people don't do it, I think it's one of the biggest, one of the biggest reason they should do it is for mental clarity.
When you're running, you don't have to focus anything.
Like even if you're a busiest human in the world, just go out, run for 20 minutes, and that's it.
Every exile that you have, every issue that you're facing at that moment will be a vanish because only thing you'll be focused is the goddamn run.
And that's what makes it run very powerful.
Imagine you want to be productive. Imagine you want to be something more than who you are.
You want to excel in certain stuff.
We are human. We cannot be at 100% at 24 hours. We can't.
We can only two hours a day that we can film the primal prime and most productive and other time not.
So in order to switch to get, like what's it, you burned out, let's say you just exhausted, you don't want to do anything, cannot focus.
And all your emotional and turbulent, emotionally going through a lot of stuff, then you need to just get out, put your favorite shoes,
put your favorite coat, and I call it on top because if you live in Boston, it's going to rain or the time.
And start running. Just keep running for just 10 minutes or 20 minutes, minimum of 20 minutes.
Run for 20 minutes and that's it and you'll be amazed how kind of transformation you're going to feel after that.
That's my speech. Thank you.
