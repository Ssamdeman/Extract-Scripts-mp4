I hope one day you realize that a person staying in a relationship waiting for you to change
is so much more than love.
That's devotion, the purest form of loyalty.
They only saw the good in you and the potential that you had, not the hurtful things you
said and did.
Just remember that next time you call them crazy or dramatic because they didn't deserve
any of that.
They forgave things they never talked about.
They made excuses for your silence, your coldness, your moods.
They loved you through the damage you refused to heal.
And even when they were hurting, they stayed soft with you.
Not because they were weak, but because they believed in you more than you believed in
yourself.
They carried the weight of your indifference and still chose to stay.
They swallowed their needs just to keep the peace.
All they ever wanted was for you to meet them halfway.
