First of all, I don't look high-look, I look shit, but that is on the point of this video.
I will have many occasions like that, and my hair looks stupid.
I look stupid.
I look fat.
I definitely look just like, fuck it.
I want that shape.
I want to get into it.
Nothing.
5, 30 seconds passed.
My throat is already moving up.
Problem solving.
Today, I want to talk about problem solving.
I think problem solving is a very broad term.
People understand it very differently.
And when you poke in that understanding, what is a problem solving?
Everybody gets it differently.
Every guy gets some gets right, some gets wrong.
But it's not often they don't not know what a problem solving is.
Today, I want to introduce you to this problem solving thing.
Problem solving, it's a way of thinking.
It's not just set of skills, it's a way of your mind.
Your neurons can't access to it.
They're not gonna be able to say, hey, it's almost time.
Look at this fat.
What?
Zinges.
Hate this.
That big film might, buddy.
I don't even know what I was talking about.
Problem solving.
Problem solving, yeah, I don't have a joke.
I don't want to talk about anything about it.
Yeah, I'm just exhausted and I don't want to talk about anything except just a smile and
just seeing myself in the image, she just made me feel like crap.
Super crap.
I just have outlines happening, but not that much.
Not that much.
I'm going to sleep.
I'm going to sleep.
Recording was not successful.
Actually, it might be.
Let me still record until five minutes and still fit into just AI that I built.
I mean, the tool I built to get my scripts of it and try to understand what's exactly
happening.
Yeah.
Yeah
I am disappointed in myself.
So I can be better than this. I know that.
I'm warning my underwear upside down. That's how you can help. I'm exhausted.
Alright, goodnight. I will take this and put it in my script, getting the scripts out of it and then see what kind of words will sound right.
It's just going to be all...
What else?
