Hello, today's topic is one of guess winter blizzards.
Right now I'm in north eastern of US and we are experiencing a blizzard.
This is one of the few times we had blizzards since 2015.
So it might set a new record of how much snow will have in the city at the end of it.
Things about blizzards that I didn't know, number one, blizzards are unexpectedly fast.
I know, I know, it seems like what blizzards mean something but if you never experience it,
you really don't know what the blizzard is.
So when I heard it's a blizzard, I thought to myself, winter, that was my idea.
But and today morning I walked out and opened the window, opened the door and I was like,
holy fuck, this is blizzard.
First time I understood what the blizzard means in the context of living and saying,
second, it's really windy.
I would not expect that to be that much wind.
I expect it to be just a lot of snow, non-stop, but what makes it a war is just wind.
It's not just wind, it's a gust of wind from...
No.
Left to right, side to side, up and down too, actually.
It is crazy.
When you look at it, you're like, wow, that's the wind.
And you can visit the sea because the snow goes with it and you're like, wow, that's wind.
I knew what the wind is but on a blizzard term, it's hard to, it's really impressive.
And third one, how are we all fucked?
Just by cities having, at least my city having constant big vehicles that are clearing the roads,
I forget the name of it, but big trouble or an oomph.
It opens the road, right?
They've been working since last night and then it doesn't look like they've been doing
shit because the roads are already snowed like that.
You don't see the road, you just see that snow pile up that up.
I'm like, wow, that's crazy.
And they think we're going to drive tomorrow?
I don't know.
So, that despite all the resources that our city put it in, to keep the...
The kids are working as a road, it seems like hard to do because the snow is going
so far as we're going to pile up, soft up.
You're like, wow, there's no way I can mess this shit all the way.
It is crazy how snowy we are.
There's a two type of blizzard.
There's a lot of type that I want to talk about in the two.
Number one is the mountain blizzard.
Blizzard is basically the same thing, but much more extreme in the mountains, obviously.
This fact, not that much interesting, but it's good to know that we have mountains and
mountains.
You can have their own blizzard timing.
And we have specifically...
The second time is a specific four northeastern.
There's a northeastern cycle blizzard.
It means that just a big cloud from cyclone basically comes in and just swaps area, creating
blizzard conditions and making it impossible to live.
And it's crazy.
One more thing that I really want to emphasize today is that we talk about winter or
blizzard, or we know it.
You heard of it.
You understand the definition of it, but if you never experience it, you don't know what
it is.
Sometimes we complain sort of stuff, but in order to really tell that we really show
that we know something, we have to experience some degree.
I think there's a big difference between understanding the words or concepts behind it,
but also experiencing it is completely different.
The same way I felt buffled by the blizzard, the experience of having a blizzard weather
right now, it just blew my mind.
That is all.
Bye.
